chapter 63 the crotch


out of the trunk the branches grow out of them the twigs so in
productive subjects grow the chapters

the crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention
it is a notched stick of a peculiar form some two feet in length which
is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow
for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the
harpoon whose other naked barbed end slopingly projects from the prow
thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler who snatches it
up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from
the wall it is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch
respectively called the first and second irons

but these two harpoons each by its own cord are both connected with
the line the object being this to dart them both if possible one
instantly after the other into the same whale so that if in the coming
drag one should draw out the other may still retain a hold it is a
doubling of the chances but it very often happens that owing to the
instantaneous violent convulsive running of the whale upon receiving
the first iron it becomes impossible for the harpooneer however
lightninglike in his movements to pitch the second iron into him
nevertheless as the second iron is already connected with the line
and the line is running hence that weapon must at all events be
anticipatingly tossed out of the boat somehow and somewhere else the
most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands tumbled into the water
it accordingly is in such cases the spare coils of box line mentioned
in a preceding chapter making this feat in most instances prudently
practicable but this critical act is not always unattended with the
saddest and most fatal casualties

furthermore you must know that when the second iron is thrown
overboard it thenceforth becomes a dangling sharpedged terror
skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale entangling the lines
or cutting them and making a prodigious sensation in all directions
nor in general is it possible to secure it again until the whale is
fairly captured and a corpse

consider now how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging
one unusually strong active and knowing whale when owing to these
qualities in him as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of
such an audacious enterprise eight or ten loose second irons may be
simultaneously dangling about him for of course each boat is supplied
with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one
be ineffectually darted without recovery all these particulars are
faithfully narrated here as they will not fail to elucidate several
most important however intricate passages in scenes hereafter to be
painted



chapter 64 stubbs supper


stubbs whale had been killed some distance from the ship it was
a calm so forming a tandem of three boats we commenced the slow
business of towing the trophy to the pequod and now as we eighteen men
with our thirtysix arms and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers
slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert sluggish corpse in the
sea and it seemed hardly to budge at all except at long intervals
good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we
moved for upon the great canal of hangho or whatever they call
it in china four or five laborers on the footpath will draw a bulky
freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this grand argosy we
towed heavily forged along as if laden with piglead in bulk

darkness came on but three lights up and down in the pequods
mainrigging dimly guided our way till drawing nearer we saw ahab
dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks vacantly eyeing
the heaving whale for a moment he issued the usual orders for securing
it for the night and then handing his lantern to a seaman went his way
into the cabin and did not come forward again until morning

though in overseeing the pursuit of this whale captain ahab had
evinced his customary activity to call it so yet now that the creature
was dead some vague dissatisfaction or impatience or despair seemed
working in him as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that
moby dick was yet to be slain and though a thousand other whales were
brought to his ship all that would not one jot advance his grand
monomaniac object very soon you would have thought from the sound on
the pequods decks that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in
the deep for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck and thrust
rattling out of the portholes but by those clanking links the vast
corpse itself not the ship is to be moored tied by the head to the
stern and by the tail to the bows the whale now lies with its black
hull close to the vessels and seen through the darkness of the night
which obscured the spars and rigging aloft the twoship and whale
seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks whereof one reclines while
the other remains standing


a little item may as well be related here the strongest and most
reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside
is by the flukes or tail and as from its greater density that part
is relatively heavier than any other excepting the sidefins its
flexibility even in death causes it to sink low beneath the surface so
that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat in order to
put the chain round it but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome a
small strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end and
a weight in its middle while the other end is secured to the ship by
adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side
of the mass so that now having girdled the whale the chain is readily
made to follow suit and being slipped along the body is at last locked
fast round the smallest part of the tail at the point of junction with
its broad flukes or lobes


if moody ahab was now all quiescence at least so far as could be known
on deck stubb his second mate flushed with conquest betrayed an
unusual but still goodnatured excitement such an unwonted bustle was
he in that the staid starbuck his official superior quietly resigned
to him for the time the sole management of affairs one small helping
cause of all this liveliness in stubb was soon made strangely manifest
stubb was a high liver he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale
as a flavorish thing to his palate

a steak a steak ere i sleep you daggoo overboard you go and cut
me one from his small

here be it known that though these wild fishermen do not as a general
thing and according to the great military maxim make the enemy defray
the current expenses of the war at least before realizing the proceeds
of the voyage yet now and then you find some of these nantucketers
who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale
designated by stubb comprising the tapering extremity of the body

about midnight that steak was cut and cooked and lighted by two
lanterns of sperm oil stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper
at the capstanhead as if that capstan were a sideboard nor was stubb
the only banqueter on whales flesh that night mingling their mumblings
with his own mastications thousands on thousands of sharks swarming
round the dead leviathan smackingly feasted on its fatness the few
sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping
of their tails against the hull within a few inches of the sleepers
hearts peering over the side you could just see them as before you
heard them wallowing in the sullen black waters and turning over on
their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the
bigness of a human head this particular feat of the shark seems all
but miraculous how at such an apparently unassailable surface they
contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls remains a part of the
universal problem of all things the mark they thus leave on the whale
may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking
for a screw

though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a seafight sharks
will be seen longingly gazing up to the ships decks like hungry dogs
round a table where red meat is being carved ready to bolt down
every killed man that is tossed to them and though while the valiant
butchers over the decktable are thus cannibally carving each others
live meat with carvingknives all gilded and tasselled the sharks
also with their jewelhilted mouths are quarrelsomely carving away
under the table at the dead meat and though were you to turn the whole
affair upside down it would still be pretty much the same thing that
is to say a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties and
though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships
crossing the atlantic systematically trotting alongside to be handy in
case a parcel is to be carried anywhere or a dead slave to be decently
buried and though one or two other like instances might be set down
touching the set terms places and occasions when sharks do most
socially congregate and most hilariously feast yet is there no
conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless
numbers and in gayer or more jovial spirits than around a dead sperm
whale moored by night to a whaleship at sea if you have never
seen that sight then suspend your decision about the propriety of
devilworship and the expediency of conciliating the devil

but as yet stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was
going on so nigh him no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his
own epicurean lips

cook cookwheres that old fleece he cried at length widening
his legs still further as if to form a more secure base for his supper
and at the same time darting his fork into the dish as if stabbing
with his lance cook you cooksail this way cook

the old black not in any very high glee at having been previously
roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour came shambling
along from his galley for like many old blacks there was something
the matter with his kneepans which he did not keep well scoured like
his other pans this old fleece as they called him came shuffling and
limping along assisting his step with his tongs which after a clumsy
fashion were made of straightened iron hoops this old ebony floundered
along and in obedience to the word of command came to a dead stop on
the opposite side of stubbs sideboard when with both hands folded
before him and resting on his twolegged cane he bowed his arched back
still further over at the same time sideways inclining his head so as
to bring his best ear into play

cook said stubb rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his
mouth dont you think this steak is rather overdone youve been
beating this steak too much cook its too tender dont i always say
that to be good a whalesteak must be tough there are those sharks
now over the side dont you see they prefer it tough and rare what a
shindy they are kicking up cook go and talk to em tell em they are
welcome to help themselves civilly and in moderation but they must
keep quiet blast me if i can hear my own voice away cook and
deliver my message here take this lantern snatching one from his
sideboard now then go and preach to em

sullenly taking the offered lantern old fleece limped across the deck
to the bulwarks and then with one hand dropping his light low over the
sea so as to get a good view of his congregation with the other hand
he solemnly flourished his tongs and leaning far over the side in a
mumbling voice began addressing the sharks while stubb softly crawling
behind overheard all that was said

fellowcritters ise ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam
noise dare you hear stop dat dam smackin ob de lips massa stubb say
dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings but by gor you
must stop dat dam racket

cook here interposed stubb accompanying the word with a sudden slap
on the shouldercook why damn your eyes you mustnt swear that way
when youre preaching thats no way to convert sinners cook

who dat den preach to him yourself sullenly turning to go

no cook go on go on

well den belubed fellowcritters

right exclaimed stubb approvingly coax em to it try that and
fleece continued

do you is all sharks and by natur wery woracious yet i zay to you
fellowcritters dat dat woraciousnesstop dat dam slappin ob de
tail how you tink to hear spose you keep up such a dam slappin and
bitin dare

cook cried stubb collaring him i wont have that swearing talk to
em gentlemanly

once more the sermon proceeded

your woraciousness fellowcritters i dont blame ye so much for dat
is natur and cant be helped but to gobern dat wicked natur dat is de
pint you is sharks sartin but if you gobern de shark in you why den
you be angel for all angel is noting more dan de shark well goberned
now look here bredren just try wonst to be cibil a helping
yourselbs from dat whale dont be tearin de blubber out your
neighbours mout i say is not one shark dood right as toder to dat
whale and by gor none on you has de right to dat whale dat whale
belong to some one else i know some o you has berry brig mout brigger
dan oders but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small bellies so dat

den for den dey sink in the sea go fast to sleep on de coral and
cant hear noting at all no more for eber and eber

upon my soul i am about of the same opinion so give the benediction
fleece and ill away to my supper

upon this fleece holding both hands over the fishy mob raised his
shrill voice and cried

cussed fellowcritters kick up de damndest row as ever you can fill
your dam bellies till dey bustand den die

now cook said stubb resuming his supper at the capstan stand
just where you stood before there over against me and pay particular
attention

all dention said fleece again stooping over upon his tongs in the
desired position

well said stubb helping himself freely meanwhile i shall now go
back to the subject of this steak in the first place how old are you
cook

what dat do wid de teak said the old black testily

silence how old are you cook

bout ninety dey say he gloomily muttered

and you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years cook
and dont know yet how to cook a whalesteak rapidly bolting another
mouthful at the last word so that morsel seemed a continuation of the
question where were you born cook

hind de hatchway in ferryboat goin ober de roanoke

born in a ferryboat thats queer too but i want to know what
country you were born in cook

didnt i say de roanoke country he cried sharply

no you didnt cook but ill tell you what im coming to cook
you must go home and be born over again you dont know how to cook a
whalesteak yet

bress my soul if i cook noder one he growled angrily turning round
to depart

come back here cookhere hand me those tongsnow take that bit of
steak there and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be
take it i sayholding the tongs towards himtake it and taste it

faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment the old negro
muttered best cooked teak i eber taste joosy berry joosy

cook said stubb squaring himself once more do you belong to the
church

passed one once in capedown said the old man sullenly

and you have once in your life passed a holy church in capetown where
you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his
beloved fellowcreatures have you cook and yet you come here and
tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now eh said stubb where
do you expect to go to cook

go to bed berry soon he mumbled halfturning as he spoke

avast heave to i mean when you die cook its an awful question now
whats your answer

when dis old brack man dies said the negro slowly changing his whole
air and demeanor he hisself wont go nowhere but some bressed angel
will come and fetch him

fetch him how in a coach and four as they fetched elijah and fetch
him where

up dere said fleece holding his tongs straight over his head and
keeping it there very solemnly

so then you expect to go up into our maintop do you cook when you
are dead but dont you know the higher you climb the colder it gets
maintop eh

didnt say dat tall said fleece again in the sulks

you said up there didnt you and now look yourself and see where
your tongs are pointing but perhaps you expect to get into heaven by
crawling through the lubbers hole cook but no no cook you dont
get there except you go the regular way round by the rigging its a
ticklish business but must be done or else its no go but none of
us are in heaven yet drop your tongs cook and hear my orders do ye

when im giving my orders cook what that your heart therethats
your gizzard aloft aloftthats itnow you have it hold it there
now and pay attention

all dention said the old black with both hands placed as desired
vainly wriggling his grizzled head as if to get both ears in front at
one and the same time

well then cook you see this whalesteak of yours was so very bad
that i have put it out of sight as soon as possible you see that dont
you well for the future when you cook another whalesteak for my
private table here the capstan ill tell you what to do so as not to
spoil it by overdoing hold the steak in one hand and show a live coal
to it with the other that done dish it dye hear and now tomorrow

goavast heaving again whaleballs for breakfastdont forget

wish by gor whale eat him stead of him eat whale im bressed if
he aint more of shark dan massa shark hisself muttered the old man
limping away with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock



chapter 65 the whale as a dish


that mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp and
like stubb eat him by his own light as you may say this seems so
outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and
philosophy of it

it is upon record that three centuries ago the tongue of the right
whale was esteemed a great delicacy in france and commanded large
prices there also that in henry viiiths time a certain cook of the
court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be
eaten with barbacued porpoises which you remember are a species of
whale porpoises indeed are to this day considered fine eating the
meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls and being well
seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtleballs or veal balls
the old monks of dunfermline were very fond of them they had a great
porpoise grant from the crown

the fact is that among his hunters at least the whale would by all
hands be considered a noble dish were there not so much of him but
when you come to sit down before a meatpie nearly one hundred feet
long it takes away your appetite only the most unprejudiced of men
like stubb nowadays partake of cooked whales but the esquimaux are not
so fastidious we all know how they live upon whales and have rare
old vintages of prime old train oil zogranda one of their most famous
doctors recommends strips of blubber for infants as being exceedingly
juicy and nourishing and this reminds me that certain englishmen who
long ago were accidentally left in greenland by a whaling vesselthat
these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of
whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber among
the dutch whalemen these scraps are called fritters which indeed
they greatly resemble being brown and crisp and smelling something
like old amsterdam housewives doughnuts or olycooks when fresh they
have such an eatable look that the most selfdenying stranger can hardly
keep his hands off

but what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish is his
exceeding richness he is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be
delicately good look at his hump which would be as fine eating as
the buffalos which is esteemed a rare dish were it not such a solid
pyramid of fat but the spermaceti itself how bland and creamy that
is like the transparent halfjellied white meat of a cocoanut in the
third month of its growth yet far too rich to supply a substitute for
butter nevertheless many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into
some other substance and then partaking of it in the long try
watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their
shipbiscuit into the huge oilpots and let them fry there awhile many
a good supper have i thus made

in the case of a small sperm whale the brains are accounted a fine dish
the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe and the two plump
whitish lobes being withdrawn precisely resembling two large puddings
they are then mixed with flour and cooked into a most delectable mess
in flavor somewhat resembling calves head which is quite a dish among
some epicures and every one knows that some young bucks among the
epicures by continually dining upon calves brains by and by get to
have a little brains of their own so as to be able to tell a
calfs head from their own heads which indeed requires uncommon
discrimination and that is the reason why a young buck with an
intelligent looking calfs head before him is somehow one of the
saddest sights you can see the head looks a sort of reproachfully at
him with an et tu brute expression

it is not perhaps entirely because the whale is so excessively
unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence
that appears to result in some way from the consideration before
mentioned ie that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea
and eat it too by its own light but no doubt the first man that ever
murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer perhaps he was hung and if
he had been put on his trial by oxen he certainly would have been and
he certainly deserved it if any murderer does go to the meatmarket
of a saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the
long rows of dead quadrupeds does not that sight take a tooth out of
the cannibals jaw cannibals who is not a cannibal i tell you it will
be more tolerable for the fejee that salted down a lean missionary in
his cellar against a coming famine it will be more tolerable for that
provident fejee i say in the day of judgment than for thee civilized
and enlightened gourmand who nailest geese to the ground and feastest
on their bloated livers in thy patedefoiegras

but stubb he eats the whale by its own light does he and that is
adding insult to injury is it look at your knifehandle there my
civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef what is
that handle made ofwhat but the bones of the brother of the very ox
you are eating and what do you pick your teeth with after devouring
that fat goose with a feather of the same fowl and with what quill did
the secretary of the society for the suppression of cruelty to ganders
formally indite his circulars it is only within the last month or two
that that society passed a resolution to patronise nothing but steel
pens



chapter 66 the shark massacre


when in the southern fishery a captured sperm whale after long and
weary toil is brought alongside late at night it is not as a general
thing at least customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting
him in for that business is an exceedingly laborious one is not very
soon completed and requires all hands to set about it therefore the
common usage is to take in all sail lash the helm alee and then send
every one below to his hammock till daylight with the reservation that
until that time anchorwatches shall be kept that is two and two for
an hour each couple the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see
that all goes well

but sometimes especially upon the line in the pacific this plan will
not answer at all because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather
round the moored carcase that were he left so for six hours say on a
stretch little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning
in most other parts of the ocean however where these fish do not so
largely abound their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably
diminished by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whalingspades
a procedure notwithstanding which in some instances only seems to
tickle them into still greater activity but it was not thus in the
present case with the pequods sharks though to be sure any man
unaccustomed to such sights to have looked over her side that night
would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese and
those sharks the maggots in it

nevertheless upon stubb setting the anchorwatch after his supper was
concluded and when accordingly queequeg and a forecastle seaman
came on deck no small excitement was created among the sharks for
immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side and lowering
three lanterns so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid
sea these two mariners darting their long whalingspades kept up an
incessant murdering of the sharks by striking the keen steel deep
into their skulls seemingly their only vital part but in the foamy
confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts the marksmen could not
always hit their mark and this brought about new revelations of the
incredible ferocity of the foe they viciously snapped not only at each
others disembowelments but like flexible bows bent round and bit
their own till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by
the same mouth to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound nor was
this all it was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these
creatures a sort of generic or pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in
their very joints and bones after what might be called the individual
life had departed killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin
one of these sharks almost took poor queequegs hand off when he tried
to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw


the whalingspade used for cuttingin is made of the very best steel
is about the bigness of a mans spread hand and in general shape
corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named only its
sides are perfectly flat and its upper end considerably narrower than
the lower this weapon is always kept as sharp as possible and when
being used is occasionally honed just like a razor in its socket a
stiff pole from twenty to thirty feet long is inserted for a handle


queequeg no care what god made him shark said the savage agonizingly
lifting his hand up and down wedder fejee god or nantucket god but de
god wat made shark must be one dam ingin



chapter 67 cutting in


it was a saturday night and such a sabbath as followed ex officio
professors of sabbath breaking are all whalemen the ivory pequod was
turned into what seemed a shamble every sailor a butcher you would
have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods

in the first place the enormous cutting tackles among other ponderous
things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green and which
no single man can possibly liftthis vast bunch of grapes was swayed up
to the maintop and firmly lashed to the lower masthead the strongest
point anywhere above a ships deck the end of the hawserlike rope
winding through these intricacies was then conducted to the windlass
and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale to
this block the great blubber hook weighing some one hundred pounds was
attached and now suspended in stages over the side starbuck and stubb
the mates armed with their long spades began cutting a hole in the
body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two
sidefins this done a broad semicircular line is cut round the hole
the hook is inserted and the main body of the crew striking up a wild
chorus now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass when
instantly the entire ship careens over on her side every bolt in
her starts like the nailheads of an old house in frosty weather she
trembles quivers and nods her frighted mastheads to the sky more
and more she leans over to the whale while every gasping heave of the
windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows till at last
a swift startling snap is heard with a great swash the ship rolls
upwards and backwards from the whale and the triumphant tackle rises
into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the
first strip of blubber now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely
as the rind does an orange so is it stripped off from the body
precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it for the
strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale
rolling over and over in the water and as the blubber in one strip
uniformly peels off along the line called the scarf simultaneously
cut by the spades of starbuck and stubb the mates and just as fast as
it is thus peeled off and indeed by that very act itself it is all the
time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the
maintop the men at the windlass then cease heaving and for a moment
or two the prodigious blooddripping mass sways to and fro as if let
down from the sky and every one present must take good heed to dodge
it when it swings else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong
overboard

one of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long keen weapon
called a boardingsword and watching his chance he dexterously slices
out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass into this
hole the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked
so as to retain a hold upon the blubber in order to prepare for what
follows whereupon this accomplished swordsman warning all hands to
stand off once more makes a scientific dash at the mass and with a few
sidelong desperate lunging slicings severs it completely in twain
so that while the short lower part is still fast the long upper strip
called a blanketpiece swings clear and is all ready for lowering
the heavers forward now resume their song and while the one tackle is
peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale the other is slowly
slackened away and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway
right beneath into an unfurnished parlor called the blubberroom into
this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long
blanketpiece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents
and thus the work proceeds the two tackles hoisting and lowering
simultaneously both whale and windlass heaving the heavers singing
the blubberroom gentlemen coiling the mates scarfing the ship
straining and all hands swearing occasionally by way of assuaging the
general friction



chapter 68 the blanket


i have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject the skin of
the whale i have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen
afloat and learned naturalists ashore my original opinion remains
unchanged but it is only an opinion

the question is what and where is the skin of the whale already you
know what his blubber is that blubber is something of the consistence
of firm closegrained beef but tougher more elastic and compact and
ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness

now however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creatures
skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness yet in point
of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption because you
cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whales body but
that same blubber and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal if
reasonably dense what can that be but the skin true from the unmarred
dead body of the whale you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely
thin transparent substance somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds
of isinglass only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin that is
previous to being dried when it not only contracts and thickens but
becomes rather hard and brittle i have several such dried bits which
i use for marks in my whalebooks it is transparent as i said before
and being laid upon the printed page i have sometimes pleased myself
with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence at any rate it is
pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles as you may
say but what i am driving at here is this that same infinitely thin
isinglass substance which i admit invests the entire body of the
whale is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature as
the skin of the skin so to speak for it were simply ridiculous to say
that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender
than the skin of a newborn child but no more of this

assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale then when this skin
as in the case of a very large sperm whale will yield the bulk of one
hundred barrels of oil and when it is considered that in quantity or
rather weight that oil in its expressed state is only three fourths
and not the entire substance of the coat some idea may hence be had
of the enormousness of that animated mass a mere part of whose mere
integument yields such a lake of liquid as that reckoning ten barrels
to the ton you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters
of the stuff of the whales skin

in life the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least among
the many marvels he presents almost invariably it is all over obliquely
crossed and recrossed with numberless straight marks in thick array
something like those in the finest italian line engravings but these
marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above
mentioned but seem to be seen through it as if they were engraved
upon the body itself nor is this all in some instances to the quick
observant eye those linear marks as in a veritable engraving but
afford the ground for far other delineations these are hieroglyphical
that is if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids
hieroglyphics then that is the proper word to use in the present
connexion by my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one sperm
whale in particular i was much struck with a plate representing the old
indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on
the banks of the upper mississippi like those mystic rocks too the
mysticmarked whale remains undecipherable this allusion to the indian
rocks reminds me of another thing besides all the other phenomena which
the exterior of the sperm whale presents he not seldom displays the
back and more especially his flanks effaced in great part of the
regular linear appearance by reason of numerous rude scratches
altogether of an irregular random aspect i should say that those new
england rocks on the seacoast which agassiz imagines to bear the marks
of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergsi should say
that those rocks must not a little resemble the sperm whale in this
particular it also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are
probably made by hostile contact with other whales for i have most
remarked them in the large fullgrown bulls of the species

a word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of
the whale it has already been said that it is stript from him in long
pieces called blanketpieces like most seaterms this one is very
happy and significant for the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber
as in a real blanket or counterpane or still better an indian poncho
slipt over his head and skirting his extremity it is by reason of this
cosy blanketing of his body that the whale is enabled to keep himself
comfortable in all weathers in all seas times and tides what would
become of a greenland whale say in those shuddering icy seas of the
north if unsupplied with his cosy surtout true other fish are
found exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean waters but these be it
observed are your coldblooded lungless fish whose very bellies
are refrigerators creatures that warm themselves under the lee of
an iceberg as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire
whereas like man the whale has lungs and warm blood freeze his blood
and he dies how wonderful is it thenexcept after explanationthat
this great monster to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it
is to man how wonderful that he should be found at home immersed
to his lips for life in those arctic waters where when seamen fall
overboard they are sometimes found months afterwards perpendicularly
frozen into the hearts of fields of ice as a fly is found glued
in amber but more surprising is it to know as has been proved by
experiment that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than that of a
borneo negro in summer

it does seem to me that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong
individual vitality and the rare virtue of thick walls and the rare
virtue of interior spaciousness oh man admire and model thyself after
the whale do thou too remain warm among ice do thou too live in
this world without being of it be cool at the equator keep thy blood
fluid at the pole like the great dome of st peters and like the
great whale retain o man in all seasons a temperature of thine own

but how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things of erections
how few are domed like st peters of creatures how few vast as the
whale



chapter 69 the funeral


haul in the chains let the carcase go astern

the vast tackles have now done their duty the peeled white body of the
beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre though changed in hue
it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk it is still colossal
slowly it floats more and more away the water round it torn and
splashed by the insatiate sharks and the air above vexed with rapacious
flights of screaming fowls whose beaks are like so many insulting
poniards in the whale the vast white headless phantom floats further
and further from the ship and every rod that it so floats what seem
square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls augment the murderous
din for hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous
sight is seen beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky upon the fair
face of the pleasant sea wafted by the joyous breezes that great mass
of death floats on and on till lost in infinite perspectives

theres a most doleful and most mocking funeral the seavultures all in
pious mourning the airsharks all punctiliously in black or speckled
in life but few of them would have helped the whale i ween if
peradventure he had needed it but upon the banquet of his funeral they
most piously do pounce oh horrible vultureism of earth from which not
the mightiest whale is free

nor is this the end desecrated as the body is a vengeful ghost
survives and hovers over it to scare espied by some timid manofwar or
blundering discoveryvessel from afar when the distance obscuring the
swarming fowls nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in
the sun and the white spray heaving high against it straightway the
whales unharming corpse with trembling fingers is set down in the
logshoals rocks and breakers hereabouts beware and for years
afterwards perhaps ships shun the place leaping over it as silly
sheep leap over a vacuum because their leader originally leaped there
when a stick was held theres your law of precedents theres your
utility of traditions theres the story of your obstinate survival of
old beliefs never bottomed on the earth and now not even hovering in
the air theres orthodoxy

thus while in life the great whales body may have been a real terror
to his foes in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a
world

are you a believer in ghosts my friend there are other ghosts than
the cocklane one and far deeper men than doctor johnson who believe in
them



chapter 70 the sphynx


it should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping
the body of the leviathan he was beheaded now the beheading of the
sperm whale is a scientific anatomical feat upon which experienced
whale surgeons very much pride themselves and not without reason

consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck
on the contrary where his head and body seem to join there in that
very place is the thickest part of him remember also that the
surgeon must operate from above some eight or ten feet intervening
between him and his subject and that subject almost hidden in a
discoloured rolling and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea bear
in mind too that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many
feet deep in the flesh and in that subterraneous manner without so
much as getting one single peep into the evercontracting gash thus
made he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent interdicted parts
and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion
into the skull do you not marvel then at stubbs boast that he
demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale

when first severed the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable
till the body is stripped that done if it belong to a small whale
it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of but with a full
grown leviathan this is impossible for the sperm whales head embraces
nearly one third of his entire bulk and completely to suspend such a
burden as that even by the immense tackles of a whaler this were as
vain a thing as to attempt weighing a dutch barn in jewellers scales

the pequods whale being decapitated and the body stripped the head was
hoisted against the ships sideabout half way out of the sea so that
it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element and there
with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it by reason of the
enormous downward drag from the lower masthead and every yardarm
on that side projecting like a crane over the waves there that
blooddripping head hung to the pequods waist like the giant
holoferness from the girdle of judith

when this last task was accomplished it was noon and the seamen went
below to their dinner silence reigned over the before tumultuous but
now deserted deck an intense copper calm like a universal yellow
lotus was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon
the sea

a short space elapsed and up into this noiselessness came ahab alone
from his cabin taking a few turns on the quarterdeck he paused to
gaze over the side then slowly getting into the mainchains he
took stubbs long spadestill remaining there after the whales
decapitationand striking it into the lower part of the halfsuspended
mass placed its other end crutchwise under one arm and so stood
leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head

it was a black and hooded head and hanging there in the midst of so
intense a calm it seemed the sphynxs in the desert speak thou vast
and venerable head muttered ahab which though ungarnished with a
beard yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses speak mighty head
and tell us the secret thing that is in thee of all divers thou hast
dived the deepest that head upon which the upper sun now gleams has
moved amid this worlds foundations where unrecorded names and navies
rust and untold hopes and anchors rot where in her murderous hold this
frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned there
in that awful waterland there was thy most familiar home thou hast
been where bell or diver never went hast slept by many a sailors side
where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down thou
sawst the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship heart
to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave true to each other when
heaven seemed false to them thou sawst the murdered mate when tossed
by pirates from the midnight deck for hours he fell into the deeper
midnight of the insatiate maw and his murderers still sailed on
unharmedwhile swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that
would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched longing arms o
head thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of
abraham and not one syllable is thine

sail ho cried a triumphant voice from the mainmasthead

aye well now thats cheering cried ahab suddenly erecting
himself while whole thunderclouds swept aside from his brow
that lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better
manwhere away

three points on the starboard bow sir and bringing down her breeze to
us

better and better man would now st paul would come along that way
and to my breezelessness bring his breeze o nature and o soul of man
how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies not the smallest
atom stirs or lives on matter but has its cunning duplicate in mind



chapter 71 the jeroboams story


hand in hand ship and breeze blew on but the breeze came faster than
the ship and soon the pequod began to rock

by and by through the glass the strangers boats and manned mastheads
proved her a whaleship but as she was so far to windward and shooting
by apparently making a passage to some other ground the pequod could
not hope to reach her so the signal was set to see what response would
be made

here be it said that like the vessels of military marines the ships of
the american whale fleet have each a private signal all which signals
being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels
attached every captain is provided with it thereby the whale
commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean even at
considerable distances and with no small facility

the pequods signal was at last responded to by the strangers setting
her own which proved the ship to be the jeroboam of nantucket squaring
her yards she bore down ranged abeam under the pequods lee and
lowered a boat it soon drew nigh but as the sideladder was being
rigged by starbucks order to accommodate the visiting captain the
stranger in question waved his hand from his boats stern in token
of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary it turned out that
the jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board and that mayhew her
captain was fearful of infecting the pequods company for though
himself and boats crew remained untainted and though his ship was half
a rifleshot off and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing
between yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the
land he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the
pequod

but this did by no means prevent all communications preserving an
interval of some few yards between itself and the ship the jeroboams
boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the
pequod as she heavily forged through the sea for by this time it blew
very fresh with her maintopsail aback though indeed at times by
the sudden onset of a large rolling wave the boat would be pushed some
way ahead but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings
again subject to this and other the like interruptions now and then a
conversation was sustained between the two parties but at intervals not
without still another interruption of a very different sort

pulling an oar in the jeroboams boat was a man of a singular
appearance even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities
make up all totalities he was a small short youngish man sprinkled
all over his face with freckles and wearing redundant yellow hair a
longskirted cabalisticallycut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped
him the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists a
deep settled fanatic delirium was in his eyes

so soon as this figure had been first descried stubb had
exclaimedthats he thats hethe longtogged scaramouch the
townhos company told us of stubb here alluded to a strange story
told of the jeroboam and a certain man among her crew some time
previous when the pequod spoke the townho according to this account
and what was subsequently learned it seemed that the scaramouch in
question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the
jeroboam his story was this

he had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of neskyeuna
shakers where he had been a great prophet in their cracked secret
meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a
trapdoor announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial which he
carried in his vestpocket but which instead of containing gunpowder
was supposed to be charged with laudanum a strange apostolic whim
having seized him he had left neskyeuna for nantucket where with
that cunning peculiar to craziness he assumed a steady commonsense
exterior and offered himself as a greenhand candidate for the
jeroboams whaling voyage they engaged him but straightway upon
the ships getting out of sight of land his insanity broke out in a
freshet he announced himself as the archangel gabriel and commanded
the captain to jump overboard he published his manifesto whereby
he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and
vicargeneral of all oceanica the unflinching earnestness with which he
declared these thingsthe dark daring play of his sleepless excited
imagination and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium united
to invest this gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant
crew with an atmosphere of sacredness moreover they were afraid of
him as such a man however was not of much practical use in the ship
especially as he refused to work except when he pleased the incredulous
captain would fain have been rid of him but apprised that that
individuals intention was to land him in the first convenient port the
archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vialsdevoting the ship
and all hands to unconditional perdition in case this intention was
carried out so strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew
that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if gabriel
was sent from the ship not a man of them would remain he was therefore
forced to relinquish his plan nor would they permit gabriel to be any
way maltreated say or do what he would so that it came to pass that
gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship the consequence of all
this was that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and
mates and since the epidemic had broken out he carried a higher hand
than ever declaring that the plague as he called it was at his sole
command nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure
the sailors mostly poor devils cringed and some of them fawned before
him in obedience to his instructions sometimes rendering him personal
homage as to a god such things may seem incredible but however
wondrous they are true nor is the history of fanatics half so striking
in respect to the measureless selfdeception of the fanatic himself as
his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others but
it is time to return to the pequod

i fear not thy epidemic man said ahab from the bulwarks to captain
mayhew who stood in the boats stern come on board

but now gabriel started to his feet

think think of the fevers yellow and bilious beware of the horrible
plague

gabriel gabriel cried captain mayhew thou must either but
that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead and its seethings
drowned all speech

hast thou seen the white whale demanded ahab when the boat drifted
back

think think of thy whaleboat stoven and sunk beware of the horrible
tail

i tell thee again gabriel that but again the boat tore ahead as if
dragged by fiends nothing was said for some moments while a succession
of riotous waves rolled by which by one of those occasional caprices
of the seas were tumbling not heaving it meantime the hoisted sperm
whales head jogged about very violently and gabriel was seen eyeing
it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to
warrant

when this interlude was over captain mayhew began a dark story
concerning moby dick not however without frequent interruptions from
gabriel whenever his name was mentioned and the crazy sea that seemed
leagued with him

it seemed that the jeroboam had not long left home when upon speaking
a whaleship her people were reliably apprised of the existence of moby
dick and the havoc he had made greedily sucking in this intelligence
gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the white
whale in case the monster should be seen in his gibbering insanity
pronouncing the white whale to be no less a being than the shaker god
incarnated the shakers receiving the bible but when some year or two
afterwards moby dick was fairly sighted from the mastheads macey the
chief mate burned with ardour to encounter him and the captain himself
being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity despite all
the archangels denunciations and forewarnings macey succeeded in
persuading five men to man his boat with them he pushed off and after
much weary pulling and many perilous unsuccessful onsets he at last
succeeded in getting one iron fast meantime gabriel ascending to
the mainroyal masthead was tossing one arm in frantic gestures and
hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants
of his divinity now while macey the mate was standing up in his
boats bow and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting
his wild exclamations upon the whale and essaying to get a fair chance
for his poised lance lo a broad white shadow rose from the sea by its
quick fanning motion temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies
of the oarsmen next instant the luckless mate so full of furious
life was smitten bodily into the air and making a long arc in his
descent fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards not a
chip of the boat was harmed nor a hair of any oarsmans head but the
mate for ever sank

it is well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accidents in the
spermwhale fishery this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any
sometimes nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated
oftener the boats bow is knocked off or the thighboard in which the
headsman stands is torn from its place and accompanies the body but
strangest of all is the circumstance that in more instances than one
when the body has been recovered not a single mark of violence is
discernible the man being stark dead

the whole calamity with the falling form of macey was plainly descried
from the ship raising a piercing shriekthe vial the vial gabriel
called off the terrorstricken crew from the further hunting of the
whale this terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence
because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically
foreannounced it instead of only making a general prophecy which any
one might have done and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the
wide margin allowed he became a nameless terror to the ship

mayhew having concluded his narration ahab put such questions to
him that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he
intended to hunt the white whale if opportunity should offer to which
ahab answeredaye straightway then gabriel once more started
to his feet glaring upon the old man and vehemently exclaimed with
downward pointed fingerthink think of the blasphemerdead and down
therebeware of the blasphemers end

ahab stolidly turned aside then said to mayhew captain i have
just bethought me of my letterbag there is a letter for one of thy
officers if i mistake not starbuck look over the bag

every whaleship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships
whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed depends
upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans thus
most letters never reach their mark and many are only received after
attaining an age of two or three years or more

soon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand it was sorely tumbled
damp and covered with a dull spotted green mould in consequence
of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin of such a letter death
himself might well have been the postboy

canst not read it cried ahab give it me man aye aye its but
a dim scrawlwhats this as he was studying it out starbuck took a
long cuttingspade pole and with his knife slightly split the end to
insert the letter there and in that way hand it to the boat without
its coming any closer to the ship

meantime ahab holding the letter muttered mr haryes mr
harrya womans pinny handthe mans wife ill wagerayemr
harry macey ship jeroboamwhy its macey and hes dead

poor fellow poor fellow and from his wife sighed mayhew but let
me have it

nay keep it thyself cried gabriel to ahab thou art soon going that
way

curses throttle thee yelled ahab captain mayhew stand by now to
receive it and taking the fatal missive from starbucks hands he
caught it in the slit of the pole and reached it over towards the boat
but as he did so the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing the boat
drifted a little towards the ships stern so that as if by magic the
letter suddenly ranged along with gabriels eager hand he clutched it
in an instant seized the boatknife and impaling the letter on it
sent it thus loaded back into the ship it fell at ahabs feet then
gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars and in
that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the pequod

as after this interlude the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket
of the whale many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild
affair



chapter 72 the monkeyrope


in the tumultuous business of cuttingin and attending to a whale there
is much running backwards and forwards among the crew now hands are
wanted here and then again hands are wanted there there is no staying
in any one place for at one and the same time everything has to be done
everywhere it is much the same with him who endeavors the description
of the scene we must now retrace our way a little it was mentioned
that upon first breaking ground in the whales back the blubberhook
was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the
mates but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook
get fixed in that hole it was inserted there by my particular friend
queequeg whose duty it was as harpooneer to descend upon the
monsters back for the special purpose referred to but in very many
cases circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the
whale till the whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded the
whale be it observed lies almost entirely submerged excepting the
immediate parts operated upon so down there some ten feet below the
level of the deck the poor harpooneer flounders about half on the
whale and half in the water as the vast mass revolves like a treadmill
beneath him on the occasion in question queequeg figured in the
highland costumea shirt and socksin which to my eyes at least
he appeared to uncommon advantage and no one had a better chance to
observe him as will presently be seen

being the savages bowsman that is the person who pulled the bowoar
in his boat the second one from forward it was my cheerful duty to
attend upon him while taking that hardscrabble scramble upon the dead
whales back you have seen italian organboys holding a dancingape by
a long cord just so from the ships steep side did i hold queequeg
down there in the sea by what is technically called in the fishery
a monkeyrope attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his
waist

it was a humorously perilous business for both of us for before we
proceed further it must be said that the monkeyrope was fast at
both ends fast to queequegs broad canvas belt and fast to my narrow
leather one so that for better or for worse we two for the time were
wedded and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more then both usage
and honour demanded that instead of cutting the cord it should drag
me down in his wake so then an elongated siamese ligature united us
queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother nor could i any way get
rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed

so strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation then that
while earnestly watching his motions i seemed distinctly to perceive
that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of
two that my free will had received a mortal wound and that anothers
mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster
and death therefore i saw that here was a sort of interregnum in
providence for its evenhanded equity never could have so gross an
injustice and yet still further ponderingwhile i jerked him now
and then from between the whale and ship which would threaten to jam
himstill further pondering i say i saw that this situation of mine
was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes only in most
cases he one way or other has this siamese connexion with a plurality
of other mortals if your banker breaks you snap if your apothecary by
mistake sends you poison in your pills you die true you may say
that by exceeding caution you may possibly escape these and the
multitudinous other evil chances of life but handle queequegs
monkeyrope heedfully as i would sometimes he jerked it so that i came
very near sliding overboard nor could i possibly forget that do what i
would i only had the management of one end of it


the monkeyrope is found in all whalers but it was only in the pequod
that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together this improvement
upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than stubb
in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible
guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkeyrope holder


i have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between the
whale and the shipwhere he would occasionally fall from the incessant
rolling and swaying of both but this was not the only jamming jeopardy
he was exposed to unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the
night the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent
blood which began to flow from the carcassthe rabid creatures swarmed
round it like bees in a beehive

and right in among those sharks was queequeg who often pushed them
aside with his floundering feet a thing altogether incredible were
it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale the otherwise
miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man

nevertheless it may well be believed that since they have such a
ravenous finger in the pie it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them
accordingly besides the monkeyrope with which i now and then jerked
the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed
a peculiarly ferocious sharkhe was provided with still another
protection suspended over the side in one of the stages tashtego
and daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen
whalespades wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could
reach this procedure of theirs to be sure was very disinterested and
benevolent of them they meant queequegs best happiness i admit but
in their hasty zeal to befriend him and from the circumstance that both
he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the bloodmuddled water
those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg
than a tall but poor queequeg i suppose straining and gasping there
with that great iron hookpoor queequeg i suppose only prayed to his
yojo and gave up his life into the hands of his gods

well well my dear comrade and twinbrother thought i as i drew in
and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the seawhat matters
it after all are you not the precious image of each and all of us men
in this whaling world that unsounded ocean you gasp in is life those
sharks your foes those spades your friends and what between sharks
and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril poor lad

but courage there is good cheer in store for you queequeg for now as
with blue lips and bloodshot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs
up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over
the side the steward advances and with a benevolent consolatory
glance hands himwhat some hot cognac no hands him ye gods hands
him a cup of tepid ginger and water

ginger do i smell ginger suspiciously asked stubb coming near
yes this must be ginger peering into the as yet untasted cup then
standing as if incredulous for a while he calmly walked towards the
astonished steward slowly saying ginger ginger and will you have
the goodness to tell me mr doughboy where lies the virtue of ginger
ginger is ginger the sort of fuel you use doughboy to kindle a fire
in this shivering cannibal gingerwhat the devil is ginger
seacoal firewoodlucifer matchestindergunpowderwhat the
devil is ginger i say that you offer this cup to our poor queequeg
here

there is some sneaking temperance society movement about this
business he suddenly added now approaching starbuck who had just
come from forward will you look at that kannakin sir smell of it
if you please then watching the mates countenance he added the
steward mr starbuck had the face to offer that calomel and jalap
to queequeg there this instant off the whale is the steward an
apothecary sir and may i ask whether this is the sort of bitters by
which he blows back the life into a halfdrowned man

i trust not said starbuck it is poor stuff enough

aye aye steward cried stubb well teach you to drug a
harpooneer none of your apothecarys medicine here you want to poison
us do ye you have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder
us all and pocket the proceeds do ye

it was not me cried doughboy it was aunt charity that brought the
ginger on board and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits but
only this gingerjubso she called it

gingerjub you gingerly rascal take that and run along with ye
to the lockers and get something better i hope i do no wrong mr
starbuck it is the captains ordersgrog for the harpooneer on a
whale

enough replied starbuck only dont hit him again but

oh i never hurt when i hit except when i hit a whale or something of
that sort and this fellows a weazel what were you about saying sir

only this go down with him and get what thou wantest thyself

when stubb reappeared he came with a dark flask in one hand and a sort
of teacaddy in the other the first contained strong spirits and was
handed to queequeg the second was aunt charitys gift and that was
freely given to the waves



chapter 73 stubb and flask kill a right whale and then have a talk
over him


it must be borne in mind that all this time we have a sperm whales
prodigious head hanging to the pequods side but we must let it
continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it
for the present other matters press and the best we can do now for the
head is to pray heaven the tackles may hold

now during the past night and forenoon the pequod had gradually
drifted into a sea which by its occasional patches of yellow brit
gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of right whales a species of the
leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking
anywhere near and though all hands commonly disdained the capture of
those inferior creatures and though the pequod was not commissioned to
cruise for them at all and though she had passed numbers of them near
the crozetts without lowering a boat yet now that a sperm whale
had been brought alongside and beheaded to the surprise of all the
announcement was made that a right whale should be captured that day if
opportunity offered

nor was this long wanting tall spouts were seen to leeward and two
boats stubbs and flasks were detached in pursuit pulling further
and further away they at last became almost invisible to the men at
the masthead but suddenly in the distance they saw a great heap of
tumultuous white water and soon after news came from aloft that one or
both the boats must be fast an interval passed and the boats were in
plain sight in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the
towing whale so close did the monster come to the hull that at
first it seemed as if he meant it malice but suddenly going down in a
maelstrom within three rods of the planks he wholly disappeared from
view as if diving under the keel cut cut was the cry from the
ship to the boats which for one instant seemed on the point of being
brought with a deadly dash against the vessels side but having plenty
of line yet in the tubs and the whale not sounding very rapidly they
paid out abundance of rope and at the same time pulled with all their
might so as to get ahead of the ship for a few minutes the struggle was
intensely critical for while they still slacked out the tightened line
in one direction and still plied their oars in another the contending
strain threatened to take them under but it was only a few feet advance
they sought to gain and they stuck to it till they did gain it when
instantly a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the
keel as the strained line scraping beneath the ship suddenly rose
to view under her bows snapping and quivering and so flinging off its
drippings that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water
while the whale beyond also rose to sight and once more the boats were
free to fly but the fagged whale abated his speed and blindly altering
his course went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after
him so that they performed a complete circuit

meantime they hauled more and more upon their lines till close
flanking him on both sides stubb answered flask with lance for
lance and thus round and round the pequod the battle went while the
multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the sperm whales body
rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled thirstily drinking at every
new gash as the eager israelites did at the new bursting fountains that
poured from the smitten rock

at last his spout grew thick and with a frightful roll and vomit he
turned upon his back a corpse

while the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes
and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing some
conversation ensued between them

i wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard said
stubb not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so
ignoble a leviathan

wants with it said flask coiling some spare line in the boats bow
did you never hear that the ship which but once has a sperm whales
head hoisted on her starboard side and at the same time a right whales
on the larboard did you never hear stubb that that ship can never
afterwards capsize

why not

i dont know but i heard that gamboge ghost of a fedallah saying so
and he seems to know all about ships charms but i sometimes think
hell charm the ship to no good at last i dont half like that chap
stubb did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into
a snakes head stubb

sink him i never look at him at all but if ever i get a chance of a
dark night and he standing hard by the bulwarks and no one by look
down there flaskpointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of
both handsaye will i flask i take that fedallah to be the devil in
disguise do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been
stowed away on board ship hes the devil i say the reason why you
dont see his tail is because he tucks it up out of sight he carries
it coiled away in his pocket i guess blast him now that i think of
it hes always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots

he sleeps in his boots dont he he hasnt got any hammock but ive
seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging

no doubt and its because of his cursed tail he coils it down do ye
see in the eye of the rigging

whats the old man have so much to do with him for

striking up a swap or a bargain i suppose

bargainabout what

why do ye see the old man is hard bent after that white whale and
the devil there is trying to come round him and get him to swap away
his silver watch or his soul or something of that sort and then hell
surrender moby dick

pooh stubb you are skylarking how can fedallah do that

i dont know flask but the devil is a curious chap and a wicked
one i tell ye why they say as how he went a sauntering into the
old flagship once switching his tail about devilish easy and
gentlemanlike and inquiring if the old governor was at home well he
was at home and asked the devil what he wanted the devil switching
his hoofs up and says i want john what for says the old
governor what business is that of yours says the devil getting
madi want to use him take him says the governorand by the
lord flask if the devil didnt give john the asiatic cholera before
he got through with him ill eat this whale in one mouthful but look
sharpaint you all ready there well then pull ahead and lets get
the whale alongside

i think i remember some such story as you were telling said flask
when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden
towards the ship but i cant remember where

three spaniards adventures of those three bloodyminded soladoes did
ye read it there flask i guess ye did

no never saw such a book heard of it though but now tell me
stubb do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now was
the same you say is now on board the pequod

am i the same man that helped kill this whale doesnt the devil live
for ever who ever heard that the devil was dead did you ever see
any parson a wearing mourning for the devil and if the devil has a
latchkey to get into the admirals cabin dont you suppose he can
crawl into a porthole tell me that mr flask

how old do you suppose fedallah is stubb

do you see that mainmast there pointing to the ship well thats
the figure one now take all the hoops in the pequods hold and string
along in a row with that mast for oughts do you see well that
wouldnt begin to be fedallahs age nor all the coopers in creation
couldnt show hoops enough to make oughts enough

but see here stubb i thought you a little boasted just now that you
meant to give fedallah a seatoss if you got a good chance now if
hes so old as all those hoops of yours come to and if he is going
to live for ever what good will it do to pitch him overboardtell me
that

give him a good ducking anyhow

but hed crawl back

duck him again and keep ducking him

suppose he should take it into his head to duck you thoughyes and
drown youwhat then

i should like to see him try it id give him such a pair of black eyes
that he wouldnt dare to show his face in the admirals cabin again for
a long while let alone down in the orlop there where he lives and
hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much damn the devil
flask so you suppose im afraid of the devil whos afraid of
him except the old governor who daresnt catch him and put him in
doubledarbies as he deserves but lets him go about kidnapping
people aye and signed a bond with him that all the people the devil
kidnapped hed roast for him theres a governor

do you suppose fedallah wants to kidnap captain ahab

do i suppose it youll know it before long flask but i am going now
to keep a sharp lookout on him and if i see anything very suspicious
going on ill just take him by the nape of his neck and saylook
here beelzebub you dont do it and if he makes any fuss by the lord
ill make a grab into his pocket for his tail take it to the capstan
and give him such a wrenching and heaving that his tail will come short
off at the stumpdo you see and then i rather guess when he finds
himself docked in that queer fashion hell sneak off without the poor
satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs

and what will you do with the tail stubb

do with it sell it for an ox whip when we get homewhat else

now do you mean what you say and have been saying all along stubb

mean or not mean here we are at the ship

the boats were here hailed to tow the whale on the larboard side where
fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing
him

didnt i tell you so said flask yes youll soon see this right
whales head hoisted up opposite that parmacettis

in good time flasks saying proved true as before the pequod steeply
leaned over towards the sperm whales head now by the counterpoise of
both heads she regained her even keel though sorely strained you may
well believe so when on one side you hoist in lockes head you go
over that way but now on the other side hoist in kants and you come
back again but in very poor plight thus some minds for ever keep
trimming boat oh ye foolish throw all these thunderheads overboard
and then you will float light and right

in disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside the
ship the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the
case of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head is cut off
whole but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and
hoisted on deck with all the well known black bone attached to what is
called the crownpiece but nothing like this in the present case
had been done the carcases of both whales had dropped astern and
the headladen ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of
overburdening panniers

meantime fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whales head and ever
and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own
hand and ahab chanced so to stand that the parsee occupied his shadow
while if the parsees shadow was there at all it seemed only to
blend with and lengthen ahabs as the crew toiled on laplandish
speculations were bandied among them concerning all these passing
things



chapter 74 the sperm whales headcontrasted view


here now are two great whales laying their heads together let us
join them and lay together our own

of the grand order of folio leviathans the sperm whale and the right
whale are by far the most noteworthy they are the only whales regularly
hunted by man to the nantucketer they present the two extremes of all
the known varieties of the whale as the external difference between
them is mainly observable in their heads and as a head of each is this
moment hanging from the pequods side and as we may freely go from one
to the other by merely stepping across the deckwhere i should like
to know will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology
than here

in the first place you are struck by the general contrast between these
heads both are massive enough in all conscience but there is a certain
mathematical symmetry in the sperm whales which the right whales sadly
lacks there is more character in the sperm whales head as you behold
it you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him in point
of pervading dignity in the present instance too this dignity is
heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit
giving token of advanced age and large experience in short he is what
the fishermen technically call a greyheaded whale

let us now note what is least dissimilar in these headsnamely the two
most important organs the eye and the ear far back on the side of
the head and low down near the angle of either whales jaw if you
narrowly search you will at last see a lashless eye which you would
fancy to be a young colts eye so out of all proportion is it to the
magnitude of the head

now from this peculiar sideway position of the whales eyes it is
plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead no more
than he can one exactly astern in a word the position of the whales
eyes corresponds to that of a mans ears and you may fancy for
yourself how it would fare with you did you sideways survey objects
through your ears you would find that you could only command some
thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight sideline of sight
and about thirty more behind it if your bitterest foe were walking
straight towards you with dagger uplifted in broad day you would not
be able to see him any more than if he were stealing upon you from
behind in a word you would have two backs so to speak but at the
same time also two fronts side fronts for what is it that makes the
front of a manwhat indeed but his eyes

moreover while in most other animals that i can now think of the eyes
are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power so as to
produce one picture and not two to the brain the peculiar position of
the whales eyes effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of
solid head which towers between them like a great mountain separating
two lakes in valleys this of course must wholly separate the
impressions which each independent organ imparts the whale therefore
must see one distinct picture on this side and another distinct
picture on that side while all between must be profound darkness and
nothingness to him man may in effect be said to look out on the world
from a sentrybox with two joined sashes for his window but with the
whale these two sashes are separately inserted making two distinct
windows but sadly impairing the view this peculiarity of the whales
eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery and to be
remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes

a curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this
visual matter as touching the leviathan but i must be content with a
hint so long as a mans eyes are open in the light the act of seeing
is involuntary that is he cannot then help mechanically seeing
whatever objects are before him nevertheless any ones experience
will teach him that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of
things at one glance it is quite impossible for him attentively
and completely to examine any two thingshowever large or however
smallat one and the same instant of time never mind if they lie side
by side and touch each other but if you now come to separate these two
objects and surround each by a circle of profound darkness then in
order to see one of them in such a manner as to bring your mind to
bear on it the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary
consciousness how is it then with the whale true both his eyes
in themselves must simultaneously act but is his brain so much more
comprehensive combining and subtle than mans that he can at the same
moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects one on one
side of him and the other in an exactly opposite direction if he
can then is it as marvellous a thing in him as if a man were able
simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems
in euclid nor strictly investigated is there any incongruity in this
comparison

it may be but an idle whim but it has always seemed to me that the
extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when
beset by three or four boats the timidity and liability to queer
frights so common to such whales i think that all this indirectly
proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition in which their
divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them

but the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye if you are an
entire stranger to their race you might hunt over these two heads
for hours and never discover that organ the ear has no external leaf
whatever and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill so
wondrously minute is it it is lodged a little behind the eye with
respect to their ears this important difference is to be observed
between the sperm whale and the right while the ear of the former has
an external opening that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered
over with a membrane so as to be quite imperceptible from without

is it not curious that so vast a being as the whale should see the
world through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an ear which
is smaller than a hares but if his eyes were broad as the lens of
herschels great telescope and his ears capacious as the porches of
cathedrals would that make him any longer of sight or sharper of
hearing not at allwhy then do you try to enlarge your mind
subtilize it

let us now with whatever levers and steamengines we have at hand cant
over the sperm whales head that it may lie bottom up then ascending
by a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and were it not
that the body is now completely separated from it with a lantern we
might descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach but
let us hold on here by this tooth and look about us where we are what
a really beautiful and chastelooking mouth from floor to ceiling
lined or rather papered with a glistening white membrane glossy as
bridal satins

but come out now and look at this portentous lower jaw which seems
like the long narrow lid of an immense snuffbox with the hinge at one
end instead of one side if you pry it up so as to get it overhead
and expose its rows of teeth it seems a terrific portcullis and such
alas it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery upon whom these
spikes fall with impaling force but far more terrible is it to behold
when fathoms down in the sea you see some sulky whale floating there
suspended with his prodigious jaw some fifteen feet long hanging
straight down at rightangles with his body for all the world like a
ships jibboom this whale is not dead he is only dispirited out of
sorts perhaps hypochondriac and so supine that the hinges of his
jaw have relaxed leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight a
reproach to all his tribe who must no doubt imprecate lockjaws upon
him

in most cases this lower jawbeing easily unhinged by a practised
artistis disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting
the ivory teeth and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone
with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles
including canes umbrellastocks and handles to ridingwhips

with a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board as if it were an
anchor and when the proper time comessome few days after the other
workqueequeg daggoo and tashtego being all accomplished dentists
are set to drawing teeth with a keen cuttingspade queequeg lances
the gums then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts and a tackle being
rigged from aloft they drag out these teeth as michigan oxen drag
stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands there are generally fortytwo
teeth in all in old whales much worn down but undecayed nor filled
after our artificial fashion the jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs and
piled away like joists for building houses



chapter 75 the right whales headcontrasted view


crossing the deck let us now have a good long look at the right whales
head

as in general shape the noble sperm whales head may be compared to a
roman warchariot especially in front where it is so broadly rounded
so at a broad view the right whales head bears a rather inelegant
resemblance to a gigantic galliottoed shoe two hundred years ago an
old dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemakers last and
in this same last or shoe that old woman of the nursery tale with
the swarming brood might very comfortably be lodged she and all her
progeny

but as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different
aspects according to your point of view if you stand on its summit and
look at these two fshaped spoutholes you would take the whole head
for an enormous bassviol and these spiracles the apertures in its
soundingboard then again if you fix your eye upon this strange
crested comblike incrustation on the top of the massthis green
barnacled thing which the greenlanders call the crown and the
southern fishers the bonnet of the right whale fixing your eyes
solely on this you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak
with a birds nest in its crotch at any rate when you watch those live
crabs that nestle here on this bonnet such an idea will be almost
sure to occur to you unless indeed your fancy has been fixed by the
technical term crown also bestowed upon it in which case you will
take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a
diademed king of the sea whose green crown has been put together for
him in this marvellous manner but if this whale be a king he is a very
sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem look at that hanging lower lip
what a huge sulk and pout is there a sulk and pout by carpenters
measurement about twenty feet long and five feet deep a sulk and pout
that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more

a great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be harelipped
the fissure is about a foot across probably the mother during an
important interval was sailing down the peruvian coast when earthquakes
caused the beach to gape over this lip as over a slippery threshold
we now slide into the mouth upon my word were i at mackinaw i should
take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam good lord is this the
road that jonah went the roof is about twelve feet high and runs to a
pretty sharp angle as if there were a regular ridgepole there while
these ribbed arched hairy sides present us with those wondrous half
vertical scimetarshaped slats of whalebone say three hundred on a
side which depending from the upper part of the head or crown
bone form those venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily
mentioned the edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres
through which the right whale strains the water and in whose
intricacies he retains the small fish when openmouthed he goes through
the seas of brit in feeding time in the central blinds of bone as they
stand in their natural order there are certain curious marks curves
hollows and ridges whereby some whalemen calculate the creatures age
as the age of an oak by its circular rings though the certainty of this
criterion is far from demonstrable yet it has the savor of analogical
probability at any rate if we yield to it we must grant a far greater
age to the right whale than at first glance will seem reasonable

in old times there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
concerning these blinds one voyager in purchas calls them the wondrous
whiskers inside of the whales mouth another hogs bristles a
third old gentleman in hackluyt uses the following elegant language
there are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his
upper chop which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth


this reminds us that the right whale really has a sort of whisker or
rather a moustache consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the
upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw sometimes these
tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn
countenance


as every one knows these same hogs bristles fins whiskers
blinds or whatever you please furnish to the ladies their busks and
other stiffening contrivances but in this particular the demand has
long been on the decline it was in queen annes time that the bone was
in its glory the farthingale being then all the fashion and as those
ancient dames moved about gaily though in the jaws of the whale as
you may say even so in a shower with the like thoughtlessness do we
nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection the umbrella being a
tent spread over the same bone

but now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment and standing
in the right whales mouth look around you afresh seeing all these
colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about would you not think
you were inside of the great haarlem organ and gazing upon its
thousand pipes for a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest
turkeythe tongue which is glued as it were to the floor of the
mouth it is very fat and tender and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting
it on deck this particular tongue now before us at a passing glance i
should say it was a sixbarreler that is it will yield you about that
amount of oil

ere this you must have plainly seen the truth of what i started
withthat the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirely
different heads to sum up then in the right whales there is no great
well of sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slender mandible of a
lower jaw like the sperm whales nor in the sperm whale are there any
of those blinds of bone no huge lower lip and scarcely anything of a
tongue again the right whale has two external spoutholes the sperm
whale only one

look your last now on these venerable hooded heads while they yet lie
together for one will soon sink unrecorded in the sea the other will
not be very long in following

can you catch the expression of the sperm whales there it is the same
he died with only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem
now faded away i think his broad brow to be full of a prairielike
placidity born of a speculative indifference as to death but mark the
other heads expression see that amazing lower lip pressed by accident
against the vessels side so as firmly to embrace the jaw does not
this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in
facing death this right whale i take to have been a stoic the sperm
whale a platonian who might have taken up spinoza in his latter years



chapter 76 the batteringram


ere quitting for the nonce the sperm whales head i would have
you as a sensible physiologist simplyparticularly remark its front
aspect in all its compacted collectedness i would have you investigate
it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated
intelligent estimate of whatever batteringram power may be lodged
there here is a vital point for you must either satisfactorily settle
this matter with yourself or for ever remain an infidel as to one of
the most appalling but not the less true events perhaps anywhere to be
found in all recorded history

you observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale
the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the
water you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably
backwards so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which
receives the boomlike lower jaw you observe that the mouth is entirely
under the head much in the same way indeed as though your own mouth
were entirely under your chin moreover you observe that the whale has
no external nose and that what nose he hashis spout holeis on the
top of his head you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides
of his head nearly one third of his entire length from the front
wherefore you must now have perceived that the front of the sperm
whales head is a dead blind wall without a single organ or tender
prominence of any sort whatsoever furthermore you are now to consider
that only in the extreme lower backward sloping part of the front of
the head is there the slightest vestige of bone and not till you
get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial
development so that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad
finally though as will soon be revealed its contents partly comprise
the most delicate oil yet you are now to be apprised of the nature of
the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy
in some previous place i have described to you how the blubber wraps the
body of the whale as the rind wraps an orange just so with the head
but with this difference about the head this envelope though not so
thick is of a boneless toughness inestimable by any man who has not
handled it the severest pointed harpoon the sharpest lance darted by
the strongest human arm impotently rebounds from it it is as though
the forehead of the sperm whale were paved with horses hoofs i do not
think that any sensation lurks in it

bethink yourself also of another thing when two large loaded indiamen
chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks what do the
sailors do they do not suspend between them at the point of coming
contact any merely hard substance like iron or wood no they hold
there a large round wad of tow and cork enveloped in the thickest
and toughest of oxhide that bravely and uninjured takes the jam which
would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crowbars by
itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact i drive at but
supplementary to this it has hypothetically occurred to me that
as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them
capable at will of distension or contraction and as the sperm whale
as far as i know has no such provision in him considering too
the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head
altogether beneath the surface and anon swims with it high elevated out
of the water considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope
considering the unique interior of his head it has hypothetically
occurred to me i say that those mystical lungcelled honeycombs there
may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with
the outer air so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and
contraction if this be so fancy the irresistibleness of that might to
which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes

now mark unerringly impelling this dead impregnable uninjurable
wall and this most buoyant thing within there swims behind it all a
mass of tremendous life only to be adequately estimated as piled wood
isby the cord and all obedient to one volition as the smallest
insect so that when i shall hereafter detail to you all the
specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this
expansive monster when i shall show you some of his more inconsiderable
braining feats i trust you will have renounced all ignorant
incredulity and be ready to abide by this that though the sperm whale
stove a passage through the isthmus of darien and mixed the atlantic
with the pacific you would not elevate one hair of your eyebrow for
unless you own the whale you are but a provincial and sentimentalist
in truth but clear truth is a thing for salamander giants only to
encounter how small the chances for the provincials then what befell
the weakling youth lifting the dread goddesss veil at lais



chapter 77 the great heidelburgh tun


now comes the baling of the case but to comprehend it aright you must
know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated
upon

regarding the sperm whales head as a solid oblong you may on an
inclined plane sideways divide it into two quoins whereof the lower
is the bony structure forming the cranium and jaws and the upper an
unctuous mass wholly free from bones its broad forward end forming the
expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale at the middle of the
forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin and then you have two
almost equal parts which before were naturally divided by an internal
wall of a thick tendinous substance


quoin is not a euclidean term it belongs to the pure nautical
mathematics i know not that it has been defined before a quoin is a
solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the
steep inclination of one side instead of the mutual tapering of both
sides


the lower subdivided part called the junk is one immense honeycomb
of oil formed by the crossing and recrossing into ten thousand
infiltrated cells of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole
extent the upper part known as the case may be regarded as the great
heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale and as that famous great tierce is
mystically carved in front so the whales vast plaited forehead forms
innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his
wondrous tun moreover as that of heidelburgh was always replenished
with the most excellent of the wines of the rhenish valleys so the tun
of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages
namely the highlyprized spermaceti in its absolutely pure limpid
and odoriferous state nor is this precious substance found unalloyed
in any other part of the creature though in life it remains perfectly
fluid yet upon exposure to the air after death it soon begins to
concrete sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots as when the
first thin delicate ice is just forming in water a large whales
case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm though from
unavoidable circumstances considerable of it is spilled leaks and
dribbles away or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business
of securing what you can

i know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun
was coated within but in superlative richness that coating could not
possibly have compared with the silken pearlcoloured membrane like the
lining of a fine pelisse forming the inner surface of the sperm whales
case

it will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale
embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head and sinceas
has been elsewhere set forththe head embraces one third of the whole
length of the creature then setting that length down at eighty feet for
a good sized whale you have more than twentysix feet for the depth
of the tun when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ships
side

as in decapitating the whale the operators instrument is brought close
to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti
magazine he has therefore to be uncommonly heedful lest a careless
untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its
invaluable contents it is this decapitated end of the head also which
is at last elevated out of the water and retained in that position by
the enormous cutting tackles whose hempen combinations on one side
make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter

thus much being said attend now i pray you to that marvellous andin
this particular instancealmost fatal operation whereby the sperm
whales great heidelburgh tun is tapped



chapter 78 cistern and buckets


nimble as a cat tashtego mounts aloft and without altering his erect
posture runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyardarm to the
part where it exactly projects over the hoisted tun he has carried
with him a light tackle called a whip consisting of only two parts
travelling through a singlesheaved block securing this block so that
it hangs down from the yardarm he swings one end of the rope till it
is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck then handoverhand down
the other part the indian drops through the air till dexterously he
lands on the summit of the head therestill high elevated above the
rest of the company to whom he vivaciously crieshe seems some turkish
muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower a
shorthandled sharp spade being sent up to him he diligently searches
for the proper place to begin breaking into the tun in this business
he proceeds very heedfully like a treasurehunter in some old house
sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in by the time
this cautious search is over a stout ironbound bucket precisely like
a wellbucket has been attached to one end of the whip while the other
end being stretched across the deck is there held by two or three
alert hands these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the indian
to whom another person has reached up a very long pole inserting this
pole into the bucket tashtego downward guides the bucket into the tun
till it entirely disappears then giving the word to the seamen at the
whip up comes the bucket again all bubbling like a dairymaids pail
of new milk carefully lowered from its height the fullfreighted
vessel is caught by an appointed hand and quickly emptied into a large
tub then remounting aloft it again goes through the same round until
the deep cistern will yield no more towards the end tashtego has to
ram his long pole harder and harder and deeper and deeper into the tun
until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down

now the people of the pequod had been baling some time in this way
several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm when all at once a
queer accident happened whether it was that tashtego that wild indian
was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his onehanded
hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head or whether the
place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy or whether the evil
one himself would have it to fall out so without stating his particular
reasons how it was exactly there is no telling now but on a sudden
as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly upmy god poor
tashtegolike the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well
dropped headforemost down into this great tun of heidelburgh and with
a horrible oily gurgling went clean out of sight

man overboard cried daggoo who amid the general consternation first
came to his senses swing the bucket this way and putting one foot
into it so as the better to secure his slippery handhold on the whip
itself the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head almost
before tashtego could have reached its interior bottom meantime
there was a terrible tumult looking over the side they saw the before
lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea
as if that moment seized with some momentous idea whereas it was only
the poor indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous
depth to which he had sunk

at this instant while daggoo on the summit of the head was clearing
the whipwhich had somehow got foul of the great cutting tacklesa
sharp cracking noise was heard and to the unspeakable horror of all
one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out and with
a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung till the drunk ship
reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg the one remaining hook
upon which the entire strain now depended seemed every instant to be
on the point of giving way an event still more likely from the violent
motions of the head

come down come down yelled the seamen to daggoo but with one hand
holding on to the heavy tackles so that if the head should drop he
would still remain suspended the negro having cleared the foul line
rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well meaning that the
buried harpooneer should grasp it and so be hoisted out

in heavens name man cried stubb are you ramming home a cartridge
thereavast how will that help him jamming that ironbound bucket on
top of his head avast will ye

stand clear of the tackle cried a voice like the bursting of a
rocket

almost in the same instant with a thunderboom the enormous mass
dropped into the sea like niagaras tablerock into the whirlpool the
suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it to far down her glittering
copper and all caught their breath as half swingingnow over the
sailors heads and now over the waterdaggoo through a thick mist of
spray was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles while poor
buriedalive tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea
but hardly had the blinding vapour cleared away when a naked figure
with a boardingsword in his hand was for one swift moment seen
hovering over the bulwarks the next a loud splash announced that my
brave queequeg had dived to the rescue one packed rush was made to the
side and every eye counted every ripple as moment followed moment and
no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen some hands now
jumped into a boat alongside and pushed a little off from the ship

ha ha cried daggoo all at once from his now quiet swinging perch
overhead and looking further off from the side we saw an arm thrust
upright from the blue waves a sight strange to see as an arm thrust
forth from the grass over a grave

both bothit is bothcried daggoo again with a joyful shout and
soon after queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand and
with the other clutching the long hair of the indian drawn into the
waiting boat they were quickly brought to the deck but tashtego was
long in coming to and queequeg did not look very brisk

now how had this noble rescue been accomplished why diving after
the slowly descending head queequeg with his keen sword had made
side lunges near its bottom so as to scuttle a large hole there then
dropping his sword had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards
and so hauled out poor tash by the head he averred that upon first
thrusting in for him a leg was presented but well knowing that that
was not as it ought to be and might occasion great troublehe had
thrust back the leg and by a dexterous heave and toss had wrought a
somerset upon the indian so that with the next trial he came forth in
the good old wayhead foremost as for the great head itself that was
doing as well as could be expected

and thus through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of queequeg
the deliverance or rather delivery of tashtego was successfully
accomplished in the teeth too of the most untoward and apparently
hopeless impediments which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten
midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing
riding and rowing

i know that this queer adventure of the gayheaders will be sure to
seem incredible to some landsmen though they themselves may have either
seen or heard of some ones falling into a cistern ashore an accident
which not seldom happens and with much less reason too than the
indians considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the
sperm whales well

but peradventure it may be sagaciously urged how is this we thought
the tissued infiltrated head of the sperm whale was the lightest and
most corky part about him and yet thou makest it sink in an element of
a far greater specific gravity than itself we have thee there not at
all but i have ye for at the time poor tash fell in the case had been
nearly emptied of its lighter contents leaving little but the dense
tendinous wall of the wella double welded hammered substance as i
have before said much heavier than the sea water and a lump of which
sinks in it like lead almost but the tendency to rapid sinking in this
substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the
other parts of the head remaining undetached from it so that it sank
very slowly and deliberately indeed affording queequeg a fair chance
for performing his agile obstetrics on the run as you may say yes it
was a running delivery so it was

now had tashtego perished in that head it had been a very precious
perishing smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant
spermaceti coffined hearsed and tombed in the secret inner chamber
and sanctum sanctorum of the whale only one sweeter end can readily be
recalledthe delicious death of an ohio honeyhunter who seeking honey
in the crotch of a hollow tree found such exceeding store of it that
leaning too far over it sucked him in so that he died embalmed
how many think ye have likewise fallen into platos honey head and
sweetly perished there



chapter 79 the prairie


to scan the lines of his face or feel the bumps on the head of this
leviathan this is a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist has as
yet undertaken such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for
lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the rock of gibraltar
or for gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the dome of the
pantheon still in that famous work of his lavater not only treats
of the various faces of men but also attentively studies the faces
of horses birds serpents and fish and dwells in detail upon the
modifications of expression discernible therein nor have gall and
his disciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the
phrenological characteristics of other beings than man therefore
though i am but ill qualified for a pioneer in the application of these
two semisciences to the whale i will do my endeavor i try all things
i achieve what i can

physiognomically regarded the sperm whale is an anomalous creature
he has no proper nose and since the nose is the central and most
conspicuous of the features and since it perhaps most modifies and
finally controls their combined expression hence it would seem that its
entire absence as an external appendage must very largely affect
the countenance of the whale for as in landscape gardening a spire
cupola monument or tower of some sort is deemed almost indispensable
to the completion of the scene so no face can be physiognomically in
keeping without the elevated openwork belfry of the nose dash the nose
from phidiass marble jove and what a sorry remainder nevertheless
leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude all his proportions are so
stately that the same deficiency which in the sculptured jove were
hideous in him is no blemish at all nay it is an added grandeur a
nose to the whale would have been impertinent as on your physiognomical
voyage you sail round his vast head in your jollyboat your noble
conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a
nose to be pulled a pestilent conceit which so often will insist upon
obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne

in some particulars perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to
be had of the sperm whale is that of the full front of his head this
aspect is sublime

in thought a fine human brow is like the east when troubled with the
morning in the repose of the pasture the curled brow of the bull has a
touch of the grand in it pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles the
elephants brow is majestic human or animal the mystical brow is as
that great golden seal affixed by the german emperors to their decrees
it signifiesgod done this day by my hand but in most creatures
nay in man himself very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine
land lying along the snow line few are the foreheads which like
shakespeares or melancthons rise so high and descend so low that the
eyes themselves seem clear eternal tideless mountain lakes and all
above them in the foreheads wrinkles you seem to track the antlered
thoughts descending there to drink as the highland hunters track the
snow prints of the deer but in the great sperm whale this high and
mighty godlike dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified
that gazing on it in that full front view you feel the deity and the
dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living
nature for you see no one point precisely not one distinct feature is
revealed no nose eyes ears or mouth no face he has none proper
nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead pleated with
riddles dumbly lowering with the doom of boats and ships and men
nor in profile does this wondrous brow diminish though that way
viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so in profile you
plainly perceive that horizontal semicrescentic depression in the
foreheads middle which in man is lavaters mark of genius

but how genius in the sperm whale has the sperm whale ever written
a book spoken a speech no his great genius is declared in his
doing nothing particular to prove it it is moreover declared in his
pyramidical silence and this reminds me that had the great sperm whale
been known to the young orient world he would have been deified by
their childmagian thoughts they deified the crocodile of the nile
because the crocodile is tongueless and the sperm whale has no
tongue or at least it is so exceedingly small as to be incapable of
protrusion if hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lure
back to their birthright the merry mayday gods of old and livingly
enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky in the now unhaunted
hill then be sure exalted to joves high seat the great sperm whale
shall lord it

champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics but there is
no champollion to decipher the egypt of every mans and every beings
face physiognomy like every other human science is but a passing
fable if then sir william jones who read in thirty languages could
not read the simplest peasants face in its profounder and more subtle
meanings how may unlettered ishmael hope to read the awful chaldee of
the sperm whales brow i but put that brow before you read it if you
can



chapter 80 the nut


if the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx to the phrenologist his
brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square

in the fullgrown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet
in length unhinge the lower jaw and the side view of this skull is as
the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level
base but in lifeas we have elsewhere seenthis inclined plane is
angularly filled up and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent
mass of the junk and sperm at the high end the skull forms a crater to
bed that part of the mass while under the long floor of this craterin
another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in
depthreposes the mere handful of this monsters brain the brain is at
least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life it is hidden
away behind its vast outworks like the innermost citadel within the
amplified fortifications of quebec so like a choice casket is it
secreted in him that i have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny
that the sperm whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance
of one formed by the cubicyards of his sperm magazine lying in strange
folds courses and convolutions to their apprehensions it seems more
in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part
of him as the seat of his intelligence

it is plain then that phrenologically the head of this leviathan in
the creatures living intact state is an entire delusion as for his
true brain you can then see no indications of it nor feel any the
whale like all things that are mighty wears a false brow to the common
world

if you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view
of its rear end which is the high end you will be struck by its
resemblance to the human skull beheld in the same situation and from
the same point of view indeed place this reversed skull scaled down
to the human magnitude among a plate of mens skulls and you would
involuntarily confound it with them and remarking the depressions on
one part of its summit in phrenological phrase you would saythis
man had no selfesteem and no veneration and by those negations
considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and
power you can best form to yourself the truest though not the most
exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is

but if from the comparative dimensions of the whales proper brain you
deem it incapable of being adequately charted then i have another idea
for you if you attentively regard almost any quadrupeds spine
you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung
necklace of dwarfed skulls all bearing rudimental resemblance to the
skull proper it is a german conceit that the vertebrae are absolutely
undeveloped skulls but the curious external resemblance i take it
the germans were not the first men to perceive a foreign friend once
pointed it out to me in the skeleton of a foe he had slain and with
the vertebrae of which he was inlaying in a sort of bassorelievo the
beaked prow of his canoe now i consider that the phrenologists have
omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the
cerebellum through the spinal canal for i believe that much of a mans
character will be found betokened in his backbone i would rather feel
your spine than your skull whoever you are a thin joist of a spine
never yet upheld a full and noble soul i rejoice in my spine as in the
firm audacious staff of that flag which i fling half out to the world

apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale his cranial
cavity is continuous with the first neckvertebra and in that vertebra
the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across being
eight in height and of a triangular figure with the base downwards as
it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size but
for a considerable distance remains of large capacity now of course
this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substancethe
spinal cordas the brain and directly communicates with the brain
and what is still more for many feet after emerging from the brains
cavity the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth almost
equal to that of the brain under all these circumstances would it be
unreasonable to survey and map out the whales spine phrenologically
for viewed in this light the wonderful comparative smallness of his
brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative
magnitude of his spinal cord

but leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists i
would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in reference to the
sperm whales hump this august hump if i mistake not rises over one
of the larger vertebrae and is therefore in some sort the outer
convex mould of it from its relative situation then i should call this
high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the sperm whale
and that the great monster is indomitable you will yet have reason to
know



chapter 81 the pequod meets the virgin


the predestinated day arrived and we duly met the ship jungfrau derick
de deer master of bremen

at one time the greatest whaling people in the world the dutch and
germans are now among the least but here and there at very wide
intervals of latitude and longitude you still occasionally meet with
their flag in the pacific

for some reason the jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects
while yet some distance from the pequod she rounded to and dropping a
boat her captain was impelled towards us impatiently standing in the
bows instead of the stern

what has he in his hand there cried starbuck pointing to something
wavingly held by the german impossiblea lampfeeder

not that said stubb no no its a coffeepot mr starbuck hes
coming off to make us our coffee is the yarman dont you see that big
tin can there alongside of himthats his boiling water oh hes all
right is the yarman

go along with you cried flask its a lampfeeder and an oilcan
hes out of oil and has come abegging

however curious it may seem for an oilship to be borrowing oil on the
whaleground and however much it may invertedly contradict the old
proverb about carrying coals to newcastle yet sometimes such a thing
really happens and in the present case captain derick de deer did
indubitably conduct a lampfeeder as flask did declare

as he mounted the deck ahab abruptly accosted him without at all
heeding what he had in his hand but in his broken lingo the german
soon evinced his complete ignorance of the white whale immediately
turning the conversation to his lampfeeder and oil can with some
remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in
profound darknesshis last drop of bremen oil being gone and not a
single flyingfish yet captured to supply the deficiency concluding
by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the fishery is technically
called a clean one that is an empty one well deserving the name of
jungfrau or the virgin

his necessities supplied derick departed but he had not gained his
ships side when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the
mastheads of both vessels and so eager for the chase was derick that
without pausing to put his oilcan and lampfeeder aboard he slewed
round his boat and made after the leviathan lampfeeders

now the game having risen to leeward he and the other three german
boats that soon followed him had considerably the start of the pequods
keels there were eight whales an average pod aware of their danger
they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind
rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness
they left a great wide wake as though continually unrolling a great
wide parchment upon the sea

full in this rapid wake and many fathoms in the rear swam a huge
humped old bull which by his comparatively slow progress as well as
by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him seemed afflicted
with the jaundice or some other infirmity whether this whale belonged
to the pod in advance seemed questionable for it is not customary for
such venerable leviathans to be at all social nevertheless he stuck
to their wake though indeed their back water must have retarded him
because the whitebone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one
like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet his spout was
short slow and laborious coming forth with a choking sort of gush
and spending itself in torn shreds followed by strange subterranean
commotions in him which seemed to have egress at his other buried
extremity causing the waters behind him to upbubble

whos got some paregoric said stubb he has the stomachache im
afraid lord think of having half an acre of stomachache adverse
winds are holding mad christmas in him boys its the first foul wind
i ever knew to blow from astern but look did ever whale yaw so before
it must be hes lost his tiller

as an overladen indiaman bearing down the hindostan coast with a deck
load of frightened horses careens buries rolls and wallows on her
way so did this old whale heave his aged bulk and now and then partly
turning over on his cumbrous ribends expose the cause of his devious
wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin whether he had lost
that fin in battle or had been born without it it were hard to say

only wait a bit old chap and ill give ye a sling for that wounded
arm cried cruel flask pointing to the whaleline near him

mind he dont sling thee with it cried starbuck give way or the
german will have him

with one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this
one fish because not only was he the largest and therefore the most
valuable whale but he was nearest to them and the other whales were
going with such great velocity moreover as almost to defy pursuit
for the time at this juncture the pequods keels had shot by the three
german boats last lowered but from the great start he had had dericks
boat still led the chase though every moment neared by his foreign
rivals the only thing they feared was that from being already so
nigh to his mark he would be enabled to dart his iron before they
could completely overtake and pass him as for derick he seemed quite
confident that this would be the case and occasionally with a deriding
gesture shook his lampfeeder at the other boats

the ungracious and ungrateful dog cried starbuck he mocks and dares
me with the very poorbox i filled for him not five minutes agothen
in his old intense whispergive way greyhounds dog to it

i tell ye what it is mencried stubb to his crewits against
my religion to get mad but id like to eat that villainous
yarmanpullwont ye are ye going to let that rascal beat ye do
ye love brandy a hogshead of brandy then to the best man come
why dont some of ye burst a bloodvessel whos that been dropping an
anchor overboardwe dont budge an inchwere becalmed halloo heres
grass growing in the boats bottomand by the lord the mast theres
budding this wont do boys look at that yarman the short and long of
it is men will ye spit fire or not

oh see the suds he makes cried flask dancing up and downwhat
a humpoh do pile on the beeflays like a log oh my lads do
springslapjacks and quahogs for supper you know my ladsbaked
clams and muffinsoh do do springhes a hundred barrellerdont
lose him nowdont oh dontsee that yarmanoh wont ye pull for
your duff my ladssuch a sog such a sogger dont ye love sperm
there goes three thousand dollars mena banka whole bank the bank
of englandoh do do dowhats that yarman about now

at this moment derick was in the act of pitching his lampfeeder at the
advancing boats and also his oilcan perhaps with the double view
of retarding his rivals way and at the same time economically
accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss

the unmannerly dutch dogger cried stubb pull now men like fifty
thousand lineofbattleship loads of redhaired devils what dye say
tashtego are you the man to snap your spine in twoandtwenty pieces
for the honour of old gayhead what dye say

i say pull like goddamcried the indian

fiercely but evenly incited by the taunts of the german the pequods
three boats now began ranging almost abreast and so disposed
momentarily neared him in that fine loose chivalrous attitude of
the headsman when drawing near to his prey the three mates stood up
proudly occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry
of there she slides now hurrah for the whiteash breeze down with
the yarman sail over him

but so decided an original start had derick had that spite of all
their gallantry he would have proved the victor in this race had not
a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade
of his midship oarsman while this clumsy lubber was striving to free
his whiteash and while in consequence dericks boat was nigh to
capsizing and he thundering away at his men in a mighty ragethat was
a good time for starbuck stubb and flask with a shout they took a
mortal start forwards and slantingly ranged up on the germans quarter
an instant more and all four boats were diagonically in the whales
immediate wake while stretching from them on both sides was the
foaming swell that he made

it was a terrific most pitiable and maddening sight the whale was
now going head out and sending his spout before him in a continual
tormented jet while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of
fright now to this hand now to that he yawed in his faltering flight
and still at every billow that he broke he spasmodically sank in the
sea or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin so have i
seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the
air vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks but the bird has a
voice and with plaintive cries will make known her fear but the fear
of this vast dumb brute of the sea was chained up and enchanted in him
he had no voice save that choking respiration through his spiracle
and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable while still in his
amazing bulk portcullis jaw and omnipotent tail there was enough to
appal the stoutest man who so pitied

seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the pequods
boats the advantage and rather than be thus foiled of his game derick
chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart
ere the last chance would for ever escape

but no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke than all three
tigersqueequeg tashtego daggooinstinctively sprang to their feet
and standing in a diagonal row simultaneously pointed their barbs and
darted over the head of the german harpooneer their three nantucket
irons entered the whale blinding vapours of foam and whitefire the
three boats in the first fury of the whales headlong rush bumped
the germans aside with such force that both derick and his baffled
harpooneer were spilled out and sailed over by the three flying keels

dont be afraid my butterboxes cried stubb casting a passing
glance upon them as he shot by yell be picked up presentlyall
righti saw some sharks asternst bernards dogs you knowrelieve
distressed travellers hurrah this is the way to sail now every keel a
sunbeam hurrahhere we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad
cougar this puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on
a plainmakes the wheelspokes fly boys when you fasten to him that
way and theres danger of being pitched out too when you strike a
hill hurrah this is the way a fellow feels when hes going to davy
jonesall a rush down an endless inclined plane hurrah this whale
carries the everlasting mail

but the monsters run was a brief one giving a sudden gasp he
tumultuously sounded with a grating rush the three lines flew round
the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them
while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would
soon exhaust the lines that using all their dexterous might they
caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on till at
lastowing to the perpendicular strain from the leadlined chocks of
the boats whence the three ropes went straight down into the bluethe
gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water while the three
sterns tilted high in the air and the whale soon ceasing to sound
for some time they remained in that attitude fearful of expending more
line though the position was a little ticklish but though boats have
been taken down and lost in this way yet it is this holding on as it
is called this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from
the back this it is that often torments the leviathan into soon rising
again to meet the sharp lance of his foes yet not to speak of the peril
of the thing it is to be doubted whether this course is always the
best for it is but reasonable to presume that the longer the stricken
whale stays under water the more he is exhausted because owing to the
enormous surface of himin a full grown sperm whale something less than
2000 square feetthe pressure of the water is immense we all know
what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under even
here aboveground in the air how vast then the burden of a whale
bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean it must at
least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres one whaleman has estimated
it at the weight of twenty lineofbattle ships with all their guns
and stores and men on board

as the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea gazing down
into its eternal blue noon and as not a single groan or cry of any
sort nay not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths
what landsman would have thought that beneath all that silence and
placidity the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in
agony not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows
seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great leviathan
was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock suspended and
to what to three bits of board is this the creature of whom it was
once so triumphantly saidcanst thou fill his skin with barbed irons
or his head with fishspears the sword of him that layeth at him cannot
hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon he esteemeth iron as
straw the arrow cannot make him flee darts are counted as stubble
he laugheth at the shaking of a spear this the creature this he oh
that unfulfilments should follow the prophets for with the strength
of a thousand thighs in his tail leviathan had run his head under the
mountains of the sea to hide him from the pequods fishspears

in that sloping afternoon sunlight the shadows that the three boats
sent down beneath the surface must have been long enough and broad
enough to shade half xerxes army who can tell how appalling to the
wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head

stand by men he stirs cried starbuck as the three lines suddenly
vibrated in the water distinctly conducting upwards to them as by
magnetic wires the life and death throbs of the whale so that every
oarsman felt them in his seat the next moment relieved in great part
from the downward strain at the bows the boats gave a sudden bounce
upwards as a small icefield will when a dense herd of white bears are
scared from it into the sea

haul in haul in cried starbuck again hes rising

the lines of which hardly an instant before not one hands breadth
could have been gained were now in long quick coils flung back all
dripping into the boats and soon the whale broke water within two
ships lengths of the hunters

his motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion in most land animals
there are certain valves or floodgates in many of their veins whereby
when wounded the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in
certain directions not so with the whale one of whose peculiarities
it is to have an entire nonvalvular structure of the bloodvessels so
that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon a deadly
drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system and when this is
heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance
below the surface his life may be said to pour from him in incessant
streams yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him and so distant
and numerous its interior fountains that he will keep thus bleeding and
bleeding for a considerable period even as in a drought a river will
flow whose source is in the wellsprings of faroff and undiscernible
hills even now when the boats pulled upon this whale and perilously
drew over his swaying flukes and the lances were darted into him
they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound which kept
continually playing while the natural spouthole in his head was only
at intervals however rapid sending its affrighted moisture into the
air from this last vent no blood yet came because no vital part of him
had thus far been struck his life as they significantly call it was
untouched

as the boats now more closely surrounded him the whole upper part of
his form with much of it that is ordinarily submerged was plainly
revealed his eyes or rather the places where his eyes had been were
beheld as strange misgrown masses gather in the knotholes of the
noblest oaks when prostrate so from the points which the whales eyes
had once occupied now protruded blind bulbs horribly pitiable to see
but pity there was none for all his old age and his one arm and his
blind eyes he must die the death and be murdered in order to light the
gay bridals and other merrymakings of men and also to illuminate the
solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all
still rolling in his blood at last he partially disclosed a strangely
discoloured bunch or protuberance the size of a bushel low down on the
flank

a nice spot cried flask just let me prick him there once

avast cried starbuck theres no need of that

but humane starbuck was too late at the instant of the dart an
ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goaded by it into more than
sufferable anguish the whale now spouting thick blood with swift fury
blindly darted at the craft bespattering them and their glorying crews
all over with showers of gore capsizing flasks boat and marring the
bows it was his death stroke for by this time so spent was he by
loss of blood that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had
made lay panting on his side impotently flapped with his stumped fin
then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world turned up
the white secrets of his belly lay like a log and died it was most
piteous that last expiring spout as when by unseen hands the water
is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain and with halfstifled
melancholy gurglings the spraycolumn lowers and lowers to the
groundso the last long dying spout of the whale

soon while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship the body
showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled immediately
by starbucks orders lines were secured to it at different points so
that ere long every boat was a buoy the sunken whale being suspended a
few inches beneath them by the cords by very heedful management when
the ship drew nigh the whale was transferred to her side and was
strongly secured there by the stiffest flukechains for it was plain
that unless artificially upheld the body would at once sink to the
bottom

it so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade
the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh
on the lower part of the bunch before described but as the stumps of
harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales
with the flesh perfectly healed around them and no prominence of any
kind to denote their place therefore there must needs have been
some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for
the ulceration alluded to but still more curious was the fact of a
lancehead of stone being found in him not far from the buried iron
the flesh perfectly firm about it who had darted that stone lance and
when it might have been darted by some nor west indian long before
america was discovered

what other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous
cabinet there is no telling but a sudden stop was put to further
discoveries by the ships being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways
to the sea owing to the bodys immensely increasing tendency to sink
however starbuck who had the ordering of affairs hung on to it to the
last hung on to it so resolutely indeed that when at length the ship
would have been capsized if still persisting in locking arms with the
body then when the command was given to break clear from it such was
the immovable strain upon the timberheads to which the flukechains and
cables were fastened that it was impossible to cast them off meantime
everything in the pequod was aslant to cross to the other side of the
deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house the ship
groaned and gasped many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and
cabins were started from their places by the unnatural dislocation
in vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable
flukechains to pry them adrift from the timberheads and so low
had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all
approached while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to
the sinking bulk and the ship seemed on the point of going over

hold on hold on wont ye cried stubb to the body dont be in such
a devil of a hurry to sink by thunder men we must do something or go
for it no use prying there avast i say with your handspikes and run
one of ye for a prayer book and a penknife and cut the big chains

knife aye aye cried queequeg and seizing the carpenters heavy
hatchet he leaned out of a porthole and steel to iron began slashing
at the largest flukechains but a few strokes full of sparks were
given when the exceeding strain effected the rest with a terrific
snap every fastening went adrift the ship righted the carcase sank

now this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed sperm
whale is a very curious thing nor has any fisherman yet adequately
accounted for it usually the dead sperm whale floats with great
buoyancy with its side or belly considerably elevated above the
surface if the only whales that thus sank were old meagre and
brokenhearted creatures their pads of lard diminished and all their
bones heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason assert that
this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so
sinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him but it
is not so for young whales in the highest health and swelling with
noble aspirations prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may of
life with all their panting lard about them even these brawny buoyant
heroes do sometimes sink

be it said however that the sperm whale is far less liable to this
accident than any other species where one of that sort go down twenty
right whales do this difference in the species is no doubt imputable in
no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale
his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton from this
incumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free but there are instances
where after the lapse of many hours or several days the sunken whale
again rises more buoyant than in life but the reason of this
is obvious gases are generated in him he swells to a prodigious
magnitude becomes a sort of animal balloon a lineofbattle ship could
hardly keep him under then in the shore whaling on soundings among
the bays of new zealand when a right whale gives token of sinking they
fasten buoys to him with plenty of rope so that when the body has gone
down they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again

it was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from
the pequods mastheads announcing that the jungfrau was again lowering
her boats though the only spout in sight was that of a finback
belonging to the species of uncapturable whales because of its
incredible power of swimming nevertheless the finbacks spout is so
similar to the sperm whales that by unskilful fishermen it is often
mistaken for it and consequently derick and all his host were now in
valiant chase of this unnearable brute the virgin crowding all sail
made after her four young keels and thus they all disappeared far to
leeward still in bold hopeful chase

oh many are the finbacks and many are the dericks my friend



chapter 82 the honour and glory of whaling


there are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true
method

the more i dive into this matter of whaling and push my researches up
to the very springhead of it so much the more am i impressed with its
great honourableness and antiquity and especially when i find so many
great demigods and heroes prophets of all sorts who one way or other
have shed distinction upon it i am transported with the reflection
that i myself belong though but subordinately to so emblazoned a
fraternity

the gallant perseus a son of jupiter was the first whaleman and
to the eternal honour of our calling be it said that the first whale
attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent those
were the knightly days of our profession when we only bore arms to
succor the distressed and not to fill mens lampfeeders every one
knows the fine story of perseus and andromeda how the lovely andromeda
the daughter of a king was tied to a rock on the seacoast and as
leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off perseus the prince
of whalemen intrepidly advancing harpooned the monster and delivered
and married the maid it was an admirable artistic exploit rarely
achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day inasmuch as this
leviathan was slain at the very first dart and let no man doubt this
arkite story for in the ancient joppa now jaffa on the syrian coast
in one of the pagan temples there stood for many ages the vast skeleton
of a whale which the citys legends and all the inhabitants asserted to
be the identical bones of the monster that perseus slew when the romans
took joppa the same skeleton was carried to italy in triumph what
seems most singular and suggestively important in this story is this
it was from joppa that jonah set sail

akin to the adventure of perseus and andromedaindeed by some supposed
to be indirectly derived from itis that famous story of st george and
the dragon which dragon i maintain to have been a whale for in many
old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together and
often stand for each other thou art as a lion of the waters and as a
dragon of the sea saith ezekiel hereby plainly meaning a whale
in truth some versions of the bible use that word itself besides it
would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had st george but
encountered a crawling reptile of the land instead of doing battle
with the great monster of the deep any man may kill a snake but only a
perseus a st george a coffin have the heart in them to march boldly
up to a whale

let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us for though
the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely
represented of a griffinlike shape and though the battle is depicted
on land and the saint on horseback yet considering the great ignorance
of those times when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists
and considering that as in perseus case st georges whale might have
crawled up out of the sea on the beach and considering that the animal
ridden by st george might have been only a large seal or seahorse
bearing all this in mind it will not appear altogether incompatible
with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene to
hold this socalled dragon no other than the great leviathan himself in
fact placed before the strict and piercing truth this whole story will
fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol of the philistines dagon by
name who being planted before the ark of israel his horses head and
both the palms of his hands fell off from him and only the stump or
fishy part of him remained thus then one of our own noble stamp even
a whaleman is the tutelary guardian of england and by good rights we
harpooneers of nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order
of st george and therefore let not the knights of that honourable
company none of whom i venture to say have ever had to do with a
whale like their great patron let them never eye a nantucketer with
disdain since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are
much better entitled to st georges decoration than they

whether to admit hercules among us or not concerning this i long
remained dubious for though according to the greek mythologies that
antique crockett and kit carsonthat brawny doer of rejoicing good
deeds was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale still whether
that strictly makes a whaleman of him that might be mooted it nowhere
appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish unless indeed
from the inside nevertheless he may be deemed a sort of involuntary
whaleman at any rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale i
claim him for one of our clan

but by the best contradictory authorities this grecian story of
hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more
ancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale and vice versa certainly
they are very similar if i claim the demigod then why not the prophet

nor do heroes saints demigods and prophets alone comprise the whole
roll of our order our grand master is still to be named for like royal
kings of old times we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing
short of the great gods themselves that wondrous oriental story is now
to be rehearsed from the shaster which gives us the dread vishnoo one
of the three persons in the godhead of the hindoos gives us this divine
vishnoo himself for our lordvishnoo who by the first of his ten
earthly incarnations has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale
when brahma or the god of gods saith the shaster resolved to recreate
the world after one of its periodical dissolutions he gave birth to
vishnoo to preside over the work but the vedas or mystical books
whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoo before
beginning the creation and which therefore must have contained
something in the shape of practical hints to young architects these
vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters so vishnoo became
incarnate in a whale and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths
rescued the sacred volumes was not this vishnoo a whaleman then even
as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman

perseus st george hercules jonah and vishnoo theres a memberroll
for you what club but the whalemans can head off like that



chapter 83 jonah historically regarded


reference was made to the historical story of jonah and the whale in the
preceding chapter now some nantucketers rather distrust this historical
story of jonah and the whale but then there were some sceptical greeks
and romans who standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times
equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale and arion and the
dolphin and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those
traditions one whit the less facts for all that

one old sagharbor whalemans chief reason for questioning the hebrew
story was thishe had one of those quaint oldfashioned bibles
embellished with curious unscientific plates one of which represented
jonahs whale with two spouts in his heada peculiarity only true
with respect to a species of the leviathan the right whale and the
varieties of that order concerning which the fishermen have this
saying a penny roll would choke him his swallow is so very small
but to this bishop jebbs anticipative answer is ready it is not
necessary hints the bishop that we consider jonah as tombed in the
whales belly but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth and
this seems reasonable enough in the good bishop for truly the
right whales mouth would accommodate a couple of whisttables and
comfortably seat all the players possibly too jonah might have
ensconced himself in a hollow tooth but on second thoughts the right
whale is toothless

another reason which sagharbor he went by that name urged for his
want of faith in this matter of the prophet was something obscurely in
reference to his incarcerated body and the whales gastric juices but
this objection likewise falls to the ground because a german exegetist
supposes that jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a
dead whaleeven as the french soldiers in the russian campaign turned
their dead horses into tents and crawled into them besides it has
been divined by other continental commentators that when jonah was
thrown overboard from the joppa ship he straightway effected his escape
to another vessel near by some vessel with a whale for a figurehead
and i would add possibly called the whale as some craft are
nowadays christened the shark the gull the eagle nor have there
been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned
in the book of jonah merely meant a lifepreserveran inflated bag
of windwhich the endangered prophet swam to and so was saved from a
watery doom poor sagharbor therefore seems worsted all round but
he had still another reason for his want of faith it was this if i
remember right jonah was swallowed by the whale in the mediterranean
sea and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days
journey of nineveh a city on the tigris very much more than three
days journey across from the nearest point of the mediterranean coast
how is that

but was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that
short distance of nineveh yes he might have carried him round by the
way of the cape of good hope but not to speak of the passage through
the whole length of the mediterranean and another passage up the
persian gulf and red sea such a supposition would involve the complete
circumnavigation of all africa in three days not to speak of the tigris
waters near the site of nineveh being too shallow for any whale to
swim in besides this idea of jonahs weathering the cape of good hope
at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great
headland from bartholomew diaz its reputed discoverer and so make
modern history a liar

but all these foolish arguments of old sagharbor only evinced his
foolish pride of reasona thing still more reprehensible in him seeing
that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the
sun and the sea i say it only shows his foolish impious pride and
abominable devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy for by a
portuguese catholic priest this very idea of jonahs going to nineveh
via the cape of good hope was advanced as a signal magnification of
the general miracle and so it was besides to this day the highly
enlightened turks devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah and
some three centuries ago an english traveller in old harriss voyages
speaks of a turkish mosque built in honour of jonah in which mosque was
a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil



chapter 84 pitchpoling


to make them run easily and swiftly the axles of carriages are
anointed and for much the same purpose some whalers perform an
analogous operation upon their boat they grease the bottom nor is it
to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm it may possibly
be of no contemptible advantage considering that oil and water are
hostile that oil is a sliding thing and that the object in view is to
make the boat slide bravely queequeg believed strongly in anointing
his boat and one morning not long after the german ship jungfrau
disappeared took more than customary pains in that occupation crawling
under its bottom where it hung over the side and rubbing in the
unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from
the crafts bald keel he seemed to be working in obedience to some
particular presentiment nor did it remain unwarranted by the event

towards noon whales were raised but so soon as the ship sailed down to
them they turned and fled with swift precipitancy a disordered flight
as of cleopatras barges from actium

nevertheless the boats pursued and stubbs was foremost by great
exertion tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron but the
stricken whale without at all sounding still continued his horizontal
flight with added fleetness such unintermitted strainings upon the
planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it it became
imperative to lance the flying whale or be content to lose him but
to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible he swam so fast and
furious what then remained

of all the wondrous devices and dexterities the sleights of hand and
countless subtleties to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced
none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling small
sword or broad sword in all its exercises boasts nothing like it it
is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale its grand
fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is
accurately darted from a violently rocking jerking boat under extreme
headway steel and wood included the entire spear is some ten or twelve
feet in length the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon
and also of a lighter materialpine it is furnished with a small rope
called a warp of considerable length by which it can be hauled back to
the hand after darting

but before going further it is important to mention here that though
the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance yet it
is seldom done and when done is still less frequently successful
on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as
compared with the lance which in effect become serious drawbacks as a
general thing therefore you must first get fast to a whale before any
pitchpoling comes into play

look now at stubb a man who from his humorous deliberate coolness and
equanimity in the direst emergencies was specially qualified to excel
in pitchpoling look at him he stands upright in the tossed bow of the
flying boat wrapt in fleecy foam the towing whale is forty feet ahead
handling the long lance lightly glancing twice or thrice along its
length to see if it be exactly straight stubb whistlingly gathers up
the coil of the warp in one hand so as to secure its free end in his
grasp leaving the rest unobstructed then holding the lance full before
his waistbands middle he levels it at the whale when covering
him with it he steadily depresses the buttend in his hand thereby
elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his
palm fifteen feet in the air he minds you somewhat of a juggler
balancing a long staff on his chin next moment with a rapid nameless
impulse in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming
distance and quivers in the life spot of the whale instead of
sparkling water he now spouts red blood

that drove the spigot out of him cried stubb tis julys immortal
fourth all fountains must run wine today would now it were old
orleans whiskey or old ohio or unspeakable old monongahela then
tashtego lad id have ye hold a canakin to the jet and wed drink
round it yea verily hearts alive wed brew choice punch in the
spread of his spouthole there and from that live punchbowl quaff the
living stuff

again and again to such gamesome talk the dexterous dart is repeated
the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful
leash the agonized whale goes into his flurry the towline is
slackened and the pitchpoler dropping astern folds his hands and
mutely watches the monster die



chapter 85 the fountain


that for six thousand yearsand no one knows how many millions of ages
beforethe great whales should have been spouting all over the sea
and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep as with so
many sprinkling or mistifying pots and that for some centuries back
thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the
whale watching these sprinklings and spoutingsthat all this should
be and yet that down to this blessed minute fifteen and a quarter
minutes past one oclock pm of this sixteenth day of december ad
1851 it should still remain a problem whether these spoutings
are after all really water or nothing but vapourthis is surely a
noteworthy thing

let us then look at this matter along with some interesting items
contingent every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their
gills the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is
combined with the element in which they swim hence a herring or a cod
might live a century and never once raise its head above the surface
but owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular
lungs like a human beings the whale can only live by inhaling the
disengaged air in the open atmosphere wherefore the necessity for
his periodical visits to the upper world but he cannot in any degree
breathe through his mouth for in his ordinary attitude the sperm
whales mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface and
what is still more his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth no he
breathes through his spiracle alone and this is on the top of his head

if i say that in any creature breathing is only a function
indispensable to vitality inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a
certain element which being subsequently brought into contact with the
blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle i do not think i
shall err though i may possibly use some superfluous scientific words
assume it and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be
aerated with one breath he might then seal up his nostrils and not
fetch another for a considerable time that is to say he would then
live without breathing anomalous as it may seem this is precisely the
case with the whale who systematically lives by intervals his full
hour and more when at the bottom without drawing a single breath or
so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air for remember he has
no gills how is this between his ribs and on each side of his spine
he is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth of
vermicellilike vessels which vessels when he quits the surface are
completely distended with oxygenated blood so that for an hour or more
a thousand fathoms in the sea he carries a surplus stock of vitality in
him just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus
supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs
the anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable and that the
supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true seems the more
cogent to me when i consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of
that leviathan in having his spoutings out as the fishermen phrase
it this is what i mean if unmolested upon rising to the surface the
sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform
with all his other unmolested risings say he stays eleven minutes and
jets seventy times that is respires seventy breaths then whenever he
rises again he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again to
a minute now if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him so that
he sounds he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular
allowance of air and not till those seventy breaths are told will he
finally go down to stay out his full term below remark however that
in different individuals these rates are different but in any one
they are alike now why should the whale thus insist upon having his
spoutings out unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air ere
descending for good how obvious is it too that this necessity for the
whales rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase for
not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught when sailing
a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight not so much thy skill then o
hunter as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee

in man breathing is incessantly going onone breath only serving
for two or three pulsations so that whatever other business he has to
attend to waking or sleeping breathe he must or die he will but the
sperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time

it has been said that the whale only breathes through his spouthole if
it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water then
i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell
seems obliterated in him for the only thing about him that at all
answers to his nose is that identical spouthole and being so clogged
with two elements it could not be expected to have the power of
smelling but owing to the mystery of the spoutwhether it be water or
whether it be vapourno absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on
this head sure it is nevertheless that the sperm whale has no proper
olfactories but what does he want of them no roses no violets no
colognewater in the sea

furthermore as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting
canal and as that long canallike the grand erie canalis furnished
with a sort of locks that open and shut for the downward retention of
air or the upward exclusion of water therefore the whale has no voice
unless you insult him by saying that when he so strangely rumbles
he talks through his nose but then again what has the whale to say
seldom have i known any profound being that had anything to say to
this world unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a
living oh happy that the world is such an excellent listener

now the spouting canal of the sperm whale chiefly intended as it
is for the conveyance of air and for several feet laid along
horizontally just beneath the upper surface of his head and a little
to one side this curious canal is very much like a gaspipe laid down
in a city on one side of a street but the question returns whether this
gaspipe is also a waterpipe in other words whether the spout of the
sperm whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath or whether that
exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth and
discharged through the spiracle it is certain that the mouth indirectly
communicates with the spouting canal but it cannot be proved that this
is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle because
the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be when in feeding he
accidentally takes in water but the sperm whales food is far beneath
the surface and there he cannot spout even if he would besides if
you regard him very closely and time him with your watch you will find
that when unmolested there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods
of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration

but why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject speak out
you have seen him spout then declare what the spout is can you not
tell water from air my dear sir in this world it is not so easy to
settle these plain things i have ever found your plain things the
knottiest of all and as for this whale spout you might almost stand in
it and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely

the central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping
it and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it
when always when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view
of his spout he is in a prodigious commotion the water cascading
all around him and if at such times you should think that you really
perceived drops of moisture in the spout how do you know that they are
not merely condensed from its vapour or how do you know that they
are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spouthole
fissure which is countersunk into the summit of the whales head for
even when tranquilly swimming through the midday sea in a calm with
his elevated hump sundried as a dromedarys in the desert even then
the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head as under
a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with
rain

nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the
precise nature of the whale spout it will not do for him to be peering
into it and putting his face in it you cannot go with your pitcher to
this fountain and fill it and bring it away for even when coming into
slight contact with the outer vapoury shreds of the jet which will
often happen your skin will feverishly smart from the acridness of
the thing so touching it and i know one who coming into still closer
contact with the spout whether with some scientific object in view
or otherwise i cannot say the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm
wherefore among whalemen the spout is deemed poisonous they try to
evade it another thing i have heard it said and i do not much doubt
it that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes it will blind you
the wisest thing the investigator can do then it seems to me is to let
this deadly spout alone

still we can hypothesize even if we cannot prove and establish my
hypothesis is this that the spout is nothing but mist and besides
other reasons to this conclusion i am impelled by considerations
touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale
i account him no common shallow being inasmuch as it is an undisputed
fact that he is never found on soundings or near shores all other
whales sometimes are he is both ponderous and profound and i am
convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings such as
plato pyrrho the devil jupiter dante and so on there always goes
up a certain semivisible steam while in the act of thinking deep
thoughts while composing a little treatise on eternity i had the
curiosity to place a mirror before me and ere long saw reflected there
a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my
head the invariable moisture of my hair while plunged in deep thought
after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic of an august noon
this seems an additional argument for the above supposition

and how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty misty monster to
behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea his vast mild
head overhung by a canopy of vapour engendered by his incommunicable
contemplations and that vapouras you will sometimes see itglorified
by a rainbow as if heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts
for dye see rainbows do not visit the clear air they only irradiate
vapour and so through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my
mind divine intuitions now and then shoot enkindling my fog with a
heavenly ray and for this i thank god for all have doubts many deny
but doubts or denials few along with them have intuitions doubts
of all things earthly and intuitions of some things heavenly this
combination makes neither believer nor infidel but makes a man who
regards them both with equal eye



chapter 86 the tail


other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope
and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights less celestial i
celebrate a tail

reckoning the largest sized sperm whales tail to begin at that point of
the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man it comprises
upon its upper surface alone an area of at least fifty square feet the
compact round body of its root expands into two broad firm flat palms
or flukes gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness
at the crotch or junction these flukes slightly overlap then sideways
recede from each other like wings leaving a wide vacancy between in
no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in
the crescentic borders of these flukes at its utmost expansion in the
full grown whale the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across

the entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews but cut
into it and you find that three distinct strata compose itupper
middle and lower the fibres in the upper and lower layers are
long and horizontal those of the middle one very short and running
crosswise between the outside layers this triune structure as much as
anything else imparts power to the tail to the student of old roman
walls the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin
course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful
relics of the antique and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the
great strength of the masonry

but as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough
the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of
muscular fibres and filaments which passing on either side the loins
and running down into the flukes insensibly blend with them and
largely contribute to their might so that in the tail the confluent
measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point
could annihilation occur to matter this were the thing to do it

nor does thisits amazing strength at all tend to cripple the graceful
flexion of its motions where infantileness of ease undulates through
a titanism of power on the contrary those motions derive their most
appalling beauty from it real strength never impairs beauty or harmony
but it often bestows it and in everything imposingly beautiful
strength has much to do with the magic take away the tied tendons that
all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved hercules and its
charm would be gone as devout eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the
naked corpse of goethe he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the
man that seemed as a roman triumphal arch when angelo paints even god
the father in human form mark what robustness is there and whatever
they may reveal of the divine love in the son the soft curled
hermaphroditical italian pictures in which his idea has been most
successfully embodied these pictures so destitute as they are of all
brawniness hint nothing of any power but the mere negative feminine
one of submission and endurance which on all hands it is conceded form
the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings

such is the subtle elasticity of the organ i treat of that whether
wielded in sport or in earnest or in anger whatever be the mood it
be in its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace therein no
fairys arm can transcend it

five great motions are peculiar to it first when used as a fin for
progression second when used as a mace in battle third in sweeping
fourth in lobtailing fifth in peaking flukes

first being horizontal in its position the leviathans tail acts in
a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures it never
wriggles in man or fish wriggling is a sign of inferiority to the
whale his tail is the sole means of propulsion scrollwise coiled
forwards beneath the body and then rapidly sprung backwards it is this
which gives that singular darting leaping motion to the monster when
furiously swimming his sidefins only serve to steer by

second it is a little significant that while one sperm whale only
fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw nevertheless in his
conflicts with man he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail in
striking at a boat he swiftly curves away his flukes from it and the
blow is only inflicted by the recoil if it be made in the unobstructed
air especially if it descend to its mark the stroke is then simply
irresistible no ribs of man or boat can withstand it your only
salvation lies in eluding it but if it comes sideways through the
opposing water then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale
boat and the elasticity of its materials a cracked rib or a dashed
plank or two a sort of stitch in the side is generally the most
serious result these submerged side blows are so often received in the
fishery that they are accounted mere childs play some one strips off
a frock and the hole is stopped

third i cannot demonstrate it but it seems to me that in the whale
the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail for in this respect
there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the
elephants trunk this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of
sweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft
slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface
of the sea and if he feel but a sailors whisker woe to that sailor
whiskers and all what tenderness there is in that preliminary touch
had this tail any prehensile power i should straightway bethink me of
darmonodes elephant that so frequented the flowermarket and with
low salutations presented nosegays to damsels and then caressed their
zones on more accounts than one a pity it is that the whale does not
possess this prehensile virtue in his tail for i have heard of yet
another elephant that when wounded in the fight curved round his trunk
and extracted the dart

fourth stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the
middle of solitary seas you find him unbent from the vast corpulence
of his dignity and kittenlike he plays on the ocean as if it were a
hearth but still you see his power in his play the broad palms of
his tail are flirted high into the air then smiting the surface the
thunderous concussion resounds for miles you would almost think a great
gun had been discharged and if you noticed the light wreath of vapour
from the spiracle at his other extremity you would think that that was
the smoke from the touchhole

fifth as in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes
lie considerably below the level of his back they are then completely
out of sight beneath the surface but when he is about to plunge into
the deeps his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are
tossed erect in the air and so remain vibrating a moment till they
downwards shoot out of view excepting the sublime breachsomewhere
else to be describedthis peaking of the whales flukes is perhaps the
grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature out of the bottomless
profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the
highest heaven so in dreams have i seen majestic satan thrusting forth
his tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell but in
gazing at such scenes it is all in all what mood you are in if in
the dantean the devils will occur to you if in that of isaiah the
archangels standing at the masthead of my ship during a sunrise that
crimsoned sky and sea i once saw a large herd of whales in the east
all heading towards the sun and for a moment vibrating in concert with
peaked flukes as it seemed to me at the time such a grand embodiment
of adoration of the gods was never beheld even in persia the home of
the fire worshippers as ptolemy philopater testified of the african
elephant i then testified of the whale pronouncing him the most devout
of all beings for according to king juba the military elephants of
antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the
profoundest silence

the chance comparison in this chapter between the whale and the
elephant so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk
of the other are concerned should not tend to place those two
opposite organs on an equality much less the creatures to which they
respectively belong for as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier
to leviathan so compared with leviathans tail his trunk is but the
stalk of a lily the most direful blow from the elephants trunk were as
the playful tap of a fan compared with the measureless crush and crash
of the sperm whales ponderous flukes which in repeated instances have
one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews
into the air very much as an indian juggler tosses his balls


though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale
and the elephant is preposterous inasmuch as in that particular the
elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to
the elephant nevertheless there are not wanting some points of curious
similitude among these is the spout it is well known that the elephant
will often draw up water or dust in his trunk and then elevating it
jet it forth in a stream


the more i consider this mighty tail the more do i deplore my inability
to express it at times there are gestures in it which though they
would well grace the hand of man remain wholly inexplicable in an
extensive herd so remarkable occasionally are these mystic gestures
that i have heard hunters who have declared them akin to freemason
signs and symbols that the whale indeed by these methods
intelligently conversed with the world nor are there wanting other
motions of the whale in his general body full of strangeness and
unaccountable to his most experienced assailant dissect him how i may
then i but go skin deep i know him not and never will but if i know
not even the tail of this whale how understand his head much more
how comprehend his face when face he has none thou shalt see my back
parts my tail he seems to say but my face shall not be seen but i
cannot completely make out his back parts and hint what he will about
his face i say again he has no face



chapter 87 the grand armada


the long and narrow peninsula of malacca extending southeastward from
the territories of birmah forms the most southerly point of all asia
in a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of
sumatra java bally and timor which with many others form a
vast mole or rampart lengthwise connecting asia with australia
and dividing the long unbroken indian ocean from the thickly studded
oriental archipelagoes this rampart is pierced by several sallyports
for the convenience of ships and whales conspicuous among which are the
straits of sunda and malacca by the straits of sunda chiefly vessels
bound to china from the west emerge into the china seas

those narrow straits of sunda divide sumatra from java and standing
midway in that vast rampart of islands buttressed by that bold green
promontory known to seamen as java head they not a little correspond
to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire and
considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices and silks and jewels
and gold and ivory with which the thousand islands of that oriental
sea are enriched it seems a significant provision of nature that such
treasures by the very formation of the land should at least bear the
appearance however ineffectual of being guarded from the allgrasping
western world the shores of the straits of sunda are unsupplied
with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the
mediterranean the baltic and the propontis unlike the danes these
orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered topsails from
the endless procession of ships before the wind which for centuries
past by night and by day have passed between the islands of sumatra
and java freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east but while
they freely waive a ceremonial like this they do by no means renounce
their claim to more solid tribute

time out of mind the piratical proas of the malays lurking among
the low shaded coves and islets of sumatra have sallied out upon the
vessels sailing through the straits fiercely demanding tribute at the
point of their spears though by the repeated bloody chastisements they
have received at the hands of european cruisers the audacity of these
corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed yet even at the present
day we occasionally hear of english and american vessels which in
those waters have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged

with a fair fresh wind the pequod was now drawing nigh to these
straits ahab purposing to pass through them into the javan sea and
thence cruising northwards over waters known to be frequented here and
there by the sperm whale sweep inshore by the philippine islands and
gain the far coast of japan in time for the great whaling season there
by these means the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almost all the
known sperm whale cruising grounds of the world previous to descending
upon the line in the pacific where ahab though everywhere else foiled
in his pursuit firmly counted upon giving battle to moby dick in the
sea he was most known to frequent and at a season when he might most
reasonably be presumed to be haunting it

but how now in this zoned quest does ahab touch no land does his crew
drink air surely he will stop for water nay for a long time now
the circusrunning sun has raced within his fiery ring and needs
no sustenance but whats in himself so ahab mark this too in the
whaler while other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff to be
transferred to foreign wharves the worldwandering whaleship carries
no cargo but herself and crew their weapons and their wants she has a
whole lakes contents bottled in her ample hold she is ballasted with
utilities not altogether with unusable piglead and kentledge she
carries years water in her clear old prime nantucket water which
when three years afloat the nantucketer in the pacific prefers to
drink before the brackish fluid but yesterday rafted off in casks from
the peruvian or indian streams hence it is that while other ships may
have gone to china from new york and back again touching at a score
of ports the whaleship in all that interval may not have sighted
one grain of soil her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like
themselves so that did you carry them the news that another flood had
come they would only answerwell boys heres the ark

now as many sperm whales had been captured off the western coast of
java in the near vicinity of the straits of sunda indeed as most of
the ground roundabout was generally recognised by the fishermen as an
excellent spot for cruising therefore as the pequod gained more
and more upon java head the lookouts were repeatedly hailed and
admonished to keep wide awake but though the green palmy cliffs of the
land soon loomed on the starboard bow and with delighted nostrils
the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air yet not a single jet was
descried almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game
hereabouts the ship had well nigh entered the straits when the
customary cheering cry was heard from aloft and ere long a spectacle of
singular magnificence saluted us

but here be it premised that owing to the unwearied activity with which
of late they have been hunted over all four oceans the sperm whales
instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies as in
former times are now frequently met with in extensive herds sometimes
embracing so great a multitude that it would almost seem as if
numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual
assistance and protection to this aggregation of the sperm whale into
such immense caravans may be imputed the circumstance that even in the
best cruising grounds you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months
together without being greeted by a single spout and then be suddenly
saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands

broad on both bows at the distance of some two or three miles and
forming a great semicircle embracing one half of the level horizon
a continuous chain of whalejets were upplaying and sparkling in the
noonday air unlike the straight perpendicular twinjets of the right
whale which dividing at top fall over in two branches like the cleft
drooping boughs of a willow the single forwardslanting spout of the
sperm whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist continually
rising and falling away to leeward

seen from the pequods deck then as she would rise on a high hill of
the sea this host of vapoury spouts individually curling up into the
air and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze showed
like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis descried
of a balmy autumnal morning by some horseman on a height

as marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains
accelerate their march all eagerness to place that perilous passage in
their rear and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain
even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through
the straits gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle and
swimming on in one solid but still crescentic centre

crowding all sail the pequod pressed after them the harpooneers
handling their weapons and loudly cheering from the heads of their
yet suspended boats if the wind only held little doubt had they that
chased through these straits of sunda the vast host would only deploy
into the oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their
number and who could tell whether in that congregated caravan moby
dick himself might not temporarily be swimming like the worshipped
whiteelephant in the coronation procession of the siamese so with
stunsail piled on stunsail we sailed along driving these leviathans
before us when of a sudden the voice of tashtego was heard loudly
directing attention to something in our wake

corresponding to the crescent in our van we beheld another in our rear
it seemed formed of detached white vapours rising and falling something
like the spouts of the whales only they did not so completely come and
go for they constantly hovered without finally disappearing levelling
his glass at this sight ahab quickly revolved in his pivothole
crying aloft there and rig whips and buckets to wet the
sailsmalays sir and after us

as if too long lurking behind the headlands till the pequod should
fairly have entered the straits these rascally asiatics were now in hot
pursuit to make up for their overcautious delay but when the swift
pequod with a fresh leading wind was herself in hot chase how very
kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to
her own chosen pursuitmere ridingwhips and rowels to her that they
were as with glass under arm ahab toandfro paced the deck in his
forward turn beholding the monsters he chased and in the after one the
bloodthirsty pirates chasing him some such fancy as the above seemed
his and when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in
which the ship was then sailing and bethought him that through that
gate lay the route to his vengeance and beheld how that through that
same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end
and not only that but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and
inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their
curseswhen all these conceits had passed through his brain ahabs
brow was left gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach after some
stormy tide has been gnawing it without being able to drag the firm
thing from its place

but thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew and
when after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern the
pequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatra
side emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond then the
harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining
upon the ship than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained
upon the malays but still driving on in the wake of the whales at
length they seemed abating their speed gradually the ship neared them
and the wind now dying away word was passed to spring to the boats but
no sooner did the herd by some presumed wonderful instinct of the sperm
whale become notified of the three keels that were after themthough
as yet a mile in their rearthan they rallied again and forming
in close ranks and battalions so that their spouts all looked like
flashing lines of stacked bayonets moved on with redoubled velocity

stripped to our shirts and drawers we sprang to the whiteash and
after several hours pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase
when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating
token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange
perplexity of inert irresolution which when the fishermen perceive
it in the whale they say he is gallied the compact martial columns
in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming were now
broken up in one measureless rout and like king porus elephants in the
indian battle with alexander they seemed going mad with consternation
in all directions expanding in vast irregular circles and aimlessly
swimming hither and thither by their short thick spoutings they
plainly betrayed their distraction of panic this was still more
strangely evinced by those of their number who completely paralysed
as it were helplessly floated like waterlogged dismantled ships on the
sea had these leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep pursued over
the pasture by three fierce wolves they could not possibly have evinced
such excessive dismay but this occasional timidity is characteristic
of almost all herding creatures though banding together in tens of
thousands the lionmaned buffaloes of the west have fled before a
solitary horseman witness too all human beings how when herded
together in the sheepfold of a theatres pit they will at the
slightest alarm of fire rush helterskelter for the outlets crowding
trampling jamming and remorselessly dashing each other to death best
therefore withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales
before us for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not
infinitely outdone by the madness of men

though many of the whales as has been said were in violent motion
yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor
retreated but collectively remained in one place as is customary in
those cases the boats at once separated each making for some one
lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal in about three minutes time
queequegs harpoon was flung the stricken fish darted blinding spray
in our faces and then running away with us like light steered straight
for the heart of the herd though such a movement on the part of the
whale struck under such circumstances is in no wise unprecedented and
indeed is almost always more or less anticipated yet does it present
one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery for as the swift
monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal you bid
adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb

as blind and deaf the whale plunged forward as if by sheer power of
speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him as we
thus tore a white gash in the sea on all sides menaced as we flew by
the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us our beset boat was
like a ship mobbed by iceisles in a tempest and striving to steer
through their complicated channels and straits knowing not at what
moment it may be locked in and crushed

but not a bit daunted queequeg steered us manfully now sheering off
from this monster directly across our route in advance now edging away
from that whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead while all the
time starbuck stood up in the bows lance in hand pricking out of our
way whatever whales he could reach by short darts for there was no time
to make long ones nor were the oarsmen quite idle though their wonted
duty was now altogether dispensed with they chiefly attended to the
shouting part of the business out of the way commodore cried one
to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface
and for an instant threatened to swamp us hard down with your tail
there cried a second to another which close to our gunwale seemed
calmly cooling himself with his own fanlike extremity

all whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances originally invented
by the nantucket indians called druggs two thick squares of wood
of equal size are stoutly clenched together so that they cross each
others grain at right angles a line of considerable length is then
attached to the middle of this block and the other end of the line
being looped it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon it is chiefly
among gallied whales that this drugg is used for then more whales
are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time but sperm
whales are not every day encountered while you may then you must
kill all you can and if you cannot kill them all at once you must wing
them so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure hence it
is that at times like these the drugg comes into requisition our boat
was furnished with three of them the first and second were successfully
darted and we saw the whales staggeringly running off fettered by the
enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg they were cramped like
malefactors with the chain and ball but upon flinging the third in the
act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block it caught under one
of the seats of the boat and in an instant tore it out and carried it
away dropping the oarsman in the boats bottom as the seat slid from
under him on both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks but we
stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in and so stopped the leaks for
the time

it had been next to impossible to dart these druggedharpoons were
it not that as we advanced into the herd our whales way greatly
diminished moreover that as we went still further and further from the
circumference of commotion the direful disorders seemed waning so that
when at last the jerking harpoon drew out and the towing whale sideways
vanished then with the tapering force of his parting momentum we
glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal as if
from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake here
the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales were heard
but not felt in this central expanse the sea presented that smooth
satinlike surface called a sleek produced by the subtle moisture
thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods yes we were now
in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every
commotion and still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of
the outer concentric circles and saw successive pods of whales eight
or ten in each swiftly going round and round like multiplied spans of
horses in a ring and so closely shoulder to shoulder that a titanic
circusrider might easily have overarched the middle ones and so have
gone round on their backs owing to the density of the crowd of reposing
whales more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd no
possible chance of escape was at present afforded us we must watch for
a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in the wall that had only
admitted us in order to shut us up keeping at the centre of the lake
we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves the women
and children of this routed host

now inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving
outer circles and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in
any one of those circles the entire area at this juncture embraced by
the whole multitude must have contained at least two or three square
miles at any ratethough indeed such a test at such a time might be
deceptivespoutings might be discovered from our low boat that
seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon i mention this
circumstance because as if the cows and calves had been purposely
locked up in this innermost fold and as if the wide extent of the
herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its
stopping or possibly being so young unsophisticated and every way
innocent and inexperienced however it may have been these smaller
whalesnow and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the
lakeevinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence or else a still
becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at like household
dogs they came snuffling round us right up to our gunwales and
touching them till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly
domesticated them queequeg patted their foreheads starbuck scratched
their backs with his lance but fearful of the consequences for the
time refrained from darting it

but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface another and still
stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side for suspended
in those watery vaults floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the
whales and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to
become mothers the lake as i have hinted was to a considerable depth
exceedingly transparent and as human infants while suckling will calmly
and fixedly gaze away from the breast as if leading two different
lives at the time and while yet drawing mortal nourishment be still
spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscenceeven so did the
young of these whales seem looking up towards us but not at us as if
we were but a bit of gulfweed in their newborn sight floating on their
sides the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us one of these little
infants that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old might
have measured some fourteen feet in length and some six feet in
girth he was a little frisky though as yet his body seemed scarce yet
recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the
maternal reticule where tail to head and all ready for the final
spring the unborn whale lies bent like a tartars bow the delicate
sidefins and the palms of his flukes still freshly retained the
plaited crumpled appearance of a babys ears newly arrived from foreign
parts

line line cried queequeg looking over the gunwale him fast him
fastwho line him who strucktwo whale one big one little

what ails ye man cried starbuck

looke here said queequeg pointing down

as when the stricken whale that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of
fathoms of rope as after deep sounding he floats up again and shows
the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the
air so now starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of madame
leviathan by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam not
seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase this natural line with
the maternal end loose becomes entangled with the hempen one so that
the cub is thereby trapped some of the subtlest secrets of the seas
seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond we saw young leviathan
amours in the deep


the sperm whale as with all other species of the leviathan but unlike
most other fish breeds indifferently at all seasons after a gestation
which may probably be set down at nine months producing but one at a
time though in some few known instances giving birth to an esau and
jacoba contingency provided for in suckling by two teats curiously
situated one on each side of the anus but the breasts themselves
extend upwards from that when by chance these precious parts in a
nursing whale are cut by the hunters lance the mothers pouring milk
and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods the milk is very sweet
and rich it has been tasted by man it might do well with strawberries
when overflowing with mutual esteem the whales salute more hominum


and thus though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations
and affrights did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and
fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments yea serenely revelled
in dalliance and delight but even so amid the tornadoed atlantic of
my being do i myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm and
while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me deep down and
deep inland there i still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy

meanwhile as we thus lay entranced the occasional sudden frantic
spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats
still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host or
possibly carrying on the war within the first circle where abundance of
room and some convenient retreats were afforded them but the sight
of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro
across the circles was nothing to what at last met our eyes it is
sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful
and alert to seek to hamstring him as it were by sundering or
maiming his gigantic tailtendon it is done by darting a shorthandled
cuttingspade to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again
a whale wounded as we afterwards learned in this part but not
effectually as it seemed had broken away from the boat carrying along
with him half of the harpoon line and in the extraordinary agony of
the wound he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone
mounted desperado arnold at the battle of saratoga carrying dismay
wherever he went

but agonizing as was the wound of this whale and an appalling spectacle
enough any way yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to
inspire the rest of the herd was owing to a cause which at first the
intervening distance obscured from us but at length we perceived that
by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery this whale had
become entangled in the harpoonline that he towed he had also run
away with the cuttingspade in him and while the free end of the rope
attached to that weapon had permanently caught in the coils of the
harpoonline round his tail the cuttingspade itself had worked loose
from his flesh so that tormented to madness he was now churning
through the water violently flailing with his flexible tail and
tossing the keen spade about him wounding and murdering his own
comrades

this terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their
stationary fright first the whales forming the margin of our lake
began to crowd a little and tumble against each other as if lifted
by half spent billows from afar then the lake itself began faintly to
heave and swell the submarine bridalchambers and nurseries vanished
in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central
circles began to swim in thickening clusters yes the long calm was
departing a low advancing hum was soon heard and then like to the
tumultuous masses of blockice when the great river hudson breaks up in
spring the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre
as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain instantly starbuck
and queequeg changed places starbuck taking the stern

oars oars he intensely whispered seizing the helmgripe your
oars and clutch your souls now my god men stand by shove him off
you queequegthe whale thereprick himhit him stand upstand
up and stay so spring menpull men never mind their backsscrape
themscrape away

the boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks leaving a
narrow dardanelles between their long lengths but by desperate endeavor
we at last shot into a temporary opening then giving way rapidly
and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet after many
similar hairbreadth escapes we at last swiftly glided into what had
just been one of the outer circles but now crossed by random whales
all violently making for one centre this lucky salvation was cheaply
purchased by the loss of queequegs hat who while standing in the bows
to prick the fugitive whales had his hat taken clean from his head by
the aireddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close
by

riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was it soon
resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement for having
clumped together at last in one dense body they then renewed their
onward flight with augmented fleetness further pursuit was useless but
the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales
might be dropped astern and likewise to secure one which flask had
killed and waifed the waif is a pennoned pole two or three of which
are carried by every boat and which when additional game is at hand
are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale both to
mark its place on the sea and also as token of prior possession should
the boats of any other ship draw near

the result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious
saying in the fisherythe more whales the less fish of all the
drugged whales only one was captured the rest contrived to escape for
the time but only to be taken as will hereafter be seen by some other
craft than the pequod



chapter 88 schools and schoolmasters


the previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of sperm
whales and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those
vast aggregations

now though such great bodies are at times encountered yet as must
have been seen even at the present day small detached bands are
occasionally observed embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each
such bands are known as schools they generally are of two sorts those
composed almost entirely of females and those mustering none but young
vigorous males or bulls as they are familiarly designated

in cavalier attendance upon the school of females you invariably see a
male of full grown magnitude but not old who upon any alarm evinces
his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his
ladies in truth this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman swimming about
over the watery world surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces
and endearments of the harem the contrast between this ottoman and
his concubines is striking because while he is always of the largest
leviathanic proportions the ladies even at full growth are not
more than onethird of the bulk of an averagesized male they are
comparatively delicate indeed i dare say not to exceed half a dozen
yards round the waist nevertheless it cannot be denied that upon the
whole they are hereditarily entitled to embonpoint

it is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent
ramblings like fashionables they are for ever on the move in leisurely
search of variety you meet them on the line in time for the full flower
of the equatorial feeding season having just returned perhaps from
spending the summer in the northern seas and so cheating summer of all
unpleasant weariness and warmth by the time they have lounged up and
down the promenade of the equator awhile they start for the oriental
waters in anticipation of the cool season there and so evade the other
excessive temperature of the year

when serenely advancing on one of these journeys if any strange
suspicious sights are seen my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his
interesting family should any unwarrantably pert young leviathan coming
that way presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies
with what prodigious fury the bashaw assails him and chases him away
high times indeed if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be
permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss though do what the
bashaw will he cannot keep the most notorious lothario out of his bed
for alas all fish bed in common as ashore the ladies often cause the
most terrible duels among their rival admirers just so with the whales
who sometimes come to deadly battle and all for love they fence with
their long lower jaws sometimes locking them together and so striving
for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers not
a few are captured having the deep scars of these encountersfurrowed
heads broken teeth scolloped fins and in some instances wrenched and
dislocated mouths

but supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at
the first rush of the harems lord then is it very diverting to watch
that lord gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and
revels there awhile still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario
like pious solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines
granting other whales to be in sight the fishermen will seldom give
chase to one of these grand turks for these grand turks are too lavish
of their strength and hence their unctuousness is small as for the
sons and the daughters they beget why those sons and daughters must
take care of themselves at least with only the maternal help for
like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named my lord
whale has no taste for the nursery however much for the bower and so
being a great traveller he leaves his anonymous babies all over the
world every baby an exotic in good time nevertheless as the ardour
of youth declines as years and dumps increase as reflection lends
her solemn pauses in short as a general lassitude overtakes the sated
turk then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens our
ottoman enters upon the impotent repentant admonitory stage of life
forswears disbands the harem and grown to an exemplary sulky old
soul goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his
prayers and warning each young leviathan from his amorous errors

now as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school so
is the lord and master of that school technically known as the
schoolmaster it is therefore not in strict character however admirably
satirical that after going to school himself he should then go abroad
inculcating not what he learned there but the folly of it his title
schoolmaster would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed
upon the harem itself but some have surmised that the man who first
thus entitled this sort of ottoman whale must have read the memoirs of
vidocq and informed himself what sort of a countryschoolmaster that
famous frenchman was in his younger days and what was the nature of
those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils

the same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale
betakes himself in his advancing years is true of all aged sperm
whales almost universally a lone whaleas a solitary leviathan is
calledproves an ancient one like venerable mossbearded daniel boone
he will have no one near him but nature herself and her he takes to
wife in the wilderness of waters and the best of wives she is though
she keeps so many moody secrets

the schools composing none but young and vigorous males previously
mentioned offer a strong contrast to the harem schools for while
those female whales are characteristically timid the young males or
fortybarrelbulls as they call them are by far the most pugnacious
of all leviathans and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter
excepting those wondrous greyheaded grizzled whales sometimes met
and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout

the fortybarrelbull schools are larger than the harem schools like
a mob of young collegians they are full of fight fun and wickedness
tumbling round the world at such a reckless rollicking rate that no
prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous
lad at yale or harvard they soon relinquish this turbulence though
and when about threefourths grown break up and separately go about in
quest of settlements that is harems

another point of difference between the male and female schools is
still more characteristic of the sexes say you strike a
fortybarrelbullpoor devil all his comrades quit him but strike
a member of the harem school and her companions swim around her with
every token of concern sometimes lingering so near her and so long as
themselves to fall a prey



chapter 89 fastfish and loosefish


the allusion to the waif and waifpoles in the last chapter but one
necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale
fishery of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge

it frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company
a whale may be struck by one vessel then escape and be finally killed
and captured by another vessel and herein are indirectly comprised
many minor contingencies all partaking of this one grand feature for
exampleafter a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale
the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm and
drifting far away to leeward be retaken by a second whaler who in a
calm snugly tows it alongside without risk of life or line thus
the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between
the fishermen were there not some written or unwritten universal
undisputed law applicable to all cases

perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative
enactment was that of holland it was decreed by the statesgeneral in
ad 1695 but though no other nation has ever had any written whaling
law yet the american fishermen have been their own legislators and
lawyers in this matter they have provided a system which for terse
comprehensiveness surpasses justinians pandects and the bylaws of
the chinese society for the suppression of meddling with other peoples
business yes these laws might be engraven on a queen annes farthing
or the barb of a harpoon and worn round the neck so small are they

i a fastfish belongs to the party fast to it

ii a loosefish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it

but what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable
brevity of it which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to
expound it

first what is a fastfish alive or dead a fish is technically fast
when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat by any medium at all
controllable by the occupant or occupantsa mast an oar a nineinch
cable a telegraph wire or a strand of cobweb it is all the same
likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif or any other
recognised symbol of possession so long as the party waifing it plainly
evince their ability at any time to take it alongside as well as their
intention so to do

these are scientific commentaries but the commentaries of the whalemen
themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocksthe
cokeuponlittleton of the fist true among the more upright and
honourable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases
where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim
possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party but
others are by no means so scrupulous

some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whaletrover litigated
in england wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of
a whale in the northern seas and when indeed they the plaintiffs had
succeeded in harpooning the fish they were at last through peril of
their lives obliged to forsake not only their lines but their boat
itself ultimately the defendants the crew of another ship came up
with the whale struck killed seized and finally appropriated it
before the very eyes of the plaintiffs and when those defendants were
remonstrated with their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs
teeth and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done
he would now retain their line harpoons and boat which had remained
attached to the whale at the time of the seizure wherefore the
plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale line
harpoons and boat

mr erskine was counsel for the defendants lord ellenborough was
the judge in the course of the defence the witty erskine went on
to illustrate his position by alluding to a recent crim con
case wherein a gentleman after in vain trying to bridle his wifes
viciousness had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life but in
the course of years repenting of that step he instituted an action to
recover possession of her erskine was on the other side and he
then supported it by saying that though the gentleman had originally
harpooned the lady and had once had her fast and only by reason of the
great stress of her plunging viciousness had at last abandoned her yet
abandon her he did so that she became a loosefish and therefore
when a subsequent gentleman reharpooned her the lady then became that
subsequent gentlemans property along with whatever harpoon might have
been found sticking in her

now in the present case erskine contended that the examples of the whale
and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other

these pleadings and the counter pleadings being duly heard the very
learned judge in set terms decided to witthat as for the boat he
awarded it to the plaintiffs because they had merely abandoned it
to save their lives but that with regard to the controverted whale
harpoons and line they belonged to the defendants the whale because
it was a loosefish at the time of the final capture and the harpoons
and line because when the fish made off with them it the fish
acquired a property in those articles and hence anybody who afterwards
took the fish had a right to them now the defendants afterwards took
the fish ergo the aforesaid articles were theirs

a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge might
possibly object to it but ploughed up to the primary rock of the
matter the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws
previously quoted and applied and elucidated by lord ellenborough in
the above cited case these two laws touching fastfish and loosefish
i say will on reflection be found the fundamentals of all human
jurisprudence for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture
the temple of the law like the temple of the philistines has but two
props to stand on

is it not a saying in every ones mouth possession is half of the law
that is regardless of how the thing came into possession but often
possession is the whole of the law what are the sinews and souls of
russian serfs and republican slaves but fastfish whereof possession is
the whole of the law what to the rapacious landlord is the widows last
mite but a fastfish what is yonder undetected villains marble mansion
with a doorplate for a waif what is that but a fastfish what is the
ruinous discount which mordecai the broker gets from poor woebegone
the bankrupt on a loan to keep woebegones family from starvation
what is that ruinous discount but a fastfish what is the archbishop of
savesouls income of l100000 seized from the scant bread and cheese
of hundreds of thousands of brokenbacked laborers all sure of heaven
without any of savesouls help what is that globular l100000 but a
fastfish what are the duke of dunders hereditary towns and hamlets
but fastfish what to that redoubted harpooneer john bull is poor
ireland but a fastfish what to that apostolic lancer brother
jonathan is texas but a fastfish and concerning all these is not
possession the whole of the law

but if the doctrine of fastfish be pretty generally applicable
the kindred doctrine of loosefish is still more widely so that is
internationally and universally applicable

what was america in 1492 but a loosefish in which columbus struck the
spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress
what was poland to the czar what greece to the turk what india
to england what at last will mexico be to the united states all
loosefish

what are the rights of man and the liberties of the world but
loosefish what all mens minds and opinions but loosefish what is
the principle of religious belief in them but a loosefish what to
the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but
loosefish what is the great globe itself but a loosefish and what
are you reader but a loosefish and a fastfish too



chapter 90 heads or tails


de balena vero sufficit si rex habeat caput et regina caudam
bracton l 3 c 3


latin from the books of the laws of england which taken along with the
context means that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of
that land the king as honourary grand harpooneer must have the head
and the queen be respectfully presented with the tail a division which
in the whale is much like halving an apple there is no intermediate
remainder now as this law under a modified form is to this day in
force in england and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly
touching the general law of fast and loosefish it is here treated of
in a separate chapter on the same courteous principle that prompts
the english railways to be at the expense of a separate car specially
reserved for the accommodation of royalty in the first place in
curious proof of the fact that the abovementioned law is still in
force i proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within
the last two years

it seems that some honest mariners of dover or sandwich or some one
of the cinque ports had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and
beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from
the shore now the cinque ports are partially or somehow under the
jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle called a lord warden
holding the office directly from the crown i believe all the royal
emoluments incident to the cinque port territories become by assignment
his by some writers this office is called a sinecure but not so
because the lord warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his
perquisites which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of
them

now when these poor sunburnt mariners barefooted and with their
trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs had wearily hauled their fat
fish high and dry promising themselves a good l150 from the precious
oil and bone and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives and good
ale with their cronies upon the strength of their respective shares up
steps a very learned and most christian and charitable gentleman with
a copy of blackstone under his arm and laying it upon the whales head
he sayshands off this fish my masters is a fastfish i seize it
as the lord wardens upon this the poor mariners in their respectful
consternationso truly englishknowing not what to say fall to
vigorously scratching their heads all round meanwhile ruefully glancing
from the whale to the stranger but that did in nowise mend the matter
or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy
of blackstone at length one of them after long scratching about for
his ideas made bold to speak

please sir who is the lord warden

the duke

but the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish

it is his

we have been at great trouble and peril and some expense and is
all that to go to the dukes benefit we getting nothing at all for our
pains but our blisters

it is his

is the duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of
getting a livelihood

it is his

i thought to relieve my old bedridden mother by part of my share of
this whale

it is his

wont the duke be content with a quarter or a half

it is his

in a word the whale was seized and sold and his grace the duke of
wellington received the money thinking that viewed in some particular
lights the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be
deemed under the circumstances a rather hard one an honest clergyman
of the town respectfully addressed a note to his grace begging him to
take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration to
which my lord duke in substance replied both letters were published
that he had already done so and received the money and would be
obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he the reverend
gentleman would decline meddling with other peoples business is
this the still militant old man standing at the corners of the three
kingdoms on all hands coercing alms of beggars

it will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the
duke to the whale was a delegated one from the sovereign we must needs
inquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally invested with
that right the law itself has already been set forth but plowdon gives
us the reason for it says plowdon the whale so caught belongs to
the king and queen because of its superior excellence and by the
soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such
matters

but why should the king have the head and the queen the tail a reason
for that ye lawyers

in his treatise on queengold or queenpinmoney an old kings bench
author one william prynne thus discourseth ye tail is ye queens
that ye queens wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone now this
was written at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland or
right whale was largely used in ladies bodices but this same bone
is not in the tail it is in the head which is a sad mistake for
a sagacious lawyer like prynne but is the queen a mermaid to be
presented with a tail an allegorical meaning may lurk here

there are two royal fish so styled by the english law writersthe whale
and the sturgeon both royal property under certain limitations and
nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crowns ordinary revenue
i know not that any other author has hinted of the matter but by
inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same
way as the whale the king receiving the highly dense and elastic head
peculiar to that fish which symbolically regarded may possibly be
humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality and thus there
seems a reason in all things even in law



chapter 91 the pequod meets the rosebud


in vain it was to rake for ambergriese in the paunch of this leviathan
insufferable fetor denying not inquiry sir t browne ve


it was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted and when we
were slowly sailing over a sleepy vapoury midday sea that the many
noses on the pequods deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the
three pairs of eyes aloft a peculiar and not very pleasant smell was
smelt in the sea

i will bet something now said stubb that somewhere hereabouts are
some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day i thought they
would keel up before long

presently the vapours in advance slid aside and there in the distance
lay a ship whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be
alongside as we glided nearer the stranger showed french colours from
his peak and by the eddying cloud of vulture seafowl that circled and
hovered and swooped around him it was plain that the whale alongside
must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale that is a whale that
has died unmolested on the sea and so floated an unappropriated corpse
it may well be conceived what an unsavory odor such a mass must
exhale worse than an assyrian city in the plague when the living are
incompetent to bury the departed so intolerable indeed is it regarded
by some that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it
yet are there those who will still do it notwithstanding the fact that
the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality and
by no means of the nature of attarofrose

coming still nearer with the expiring breeze we saw that the frenchman
had a second whale alongside and this second whale seemed even more
of a nosegay than the first in truth it turned out to be one of
those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort
of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defunct bodies
almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil nevertheless in the
proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn
up his nose at such a whale as this however much he may shun blasted
whales in general

the pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that stubb vowed
he recognised his cutting spadepole entangled in the lines that were
knotted round the tail of one of these whales

theres a pretty fellow now he banteringly laughed standing in the
ships bows theres a jackal for ye i well know that these crappoes
of frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery sometimes lowering
their boats for breakers mistaking them for sperm whale spouts yes
and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of
tallow candles and cases of snuffers foreseeing that all the oil they
will get wont be enough to dip the captains wick into aye we all
know these things but look ye heres a crappo that is content with our
leavings the drugged whale there i mean aye and is content too with
scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there poor
devil i say pass round a hat some one and lets make him a present
of a little oil for dear charitys sake for what oil hell get from
that drugged whale there wouldnt be fit to burn in a jail no not
in a condemned cell and as for the other whale why ill agree to get
more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours than
hell get from that bundle of bones though now that i think of it it
may contain something worth a good deal more than oil yes ambergris
i wonder now if our old man has thought of that its worth trying yes
im for it and so saying he started for the quarterdeck

by this time the faint air had become a complete calm so that whether
or no the pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell with no hope of
escaping except by its breezing up again issuing from the cabin stubb
now called his boats crew and pulled off for the stranger drawing
across her bow he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful french
taste the upper part of her stempiece was carved in the likeness of a
huge drooping stalk was painted green and for thorns had copper
spikes projecting from it here and there the whole terminating in a
symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour upon her head boards in
large gilt letters he read bouton de roserosebutton or rosebud
and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship

though stubb did not understand the bouton part of the inscription yet
the word rose and the bulbous figurehead put together sufficiently
explained the whole to him

a wooden rosebud eh he cried with his hand to his nose that will
do very well but how like all creation it smells

now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck he
had to pull round the bows to the starboard side and thus come close to
the blasted whale and so talk over it

arrived then at this spot with one hand still to his nose he
bawledboutonderose ahoy are there any of you boutonderoses that
speak english

yes rejoined a guernseyman from the bulwarks who turned out to be
the chiefmate

well then my boutonderosebud have you seen the white whale

what whale

the white whalea sperm whalemoby dick have ye seen him

never heard of such a whale cachalot blanche white whaleno

very good then good bye now and ill call again in a minute

then rapidly pulling back towards the pequod and seeing ahab leaning
over the quarterdeck rail awaiting his report he moulded his two hands
into a trumpet and shoutedno sir no upon which ahab retired and
stubb returned to the frenchman

he now perceived that the guernseyman who had just got into the
chains and was using a cuttingspade had slung his nose in a sort of
bag

whats the matter with your nose there said stubb broke it

i wish it was broken or that i didnt have any nose at all answered
the guernseyman who did not seem to relish the job he was at very
much but what are you holding yours for

oh nothing its a wax nose i have to hold it on fine day aint it
air rather gardenny i should say throw us a bunch of posies will ye
boutonderose

what in the devils name do you want here roared the guernseyman
flying into a sudden passion

oh keep coolcool yes thats the word why dont you pack those
whales in ice while youre working at em but joking aside though do
you know rosebud that its all nonsense trying to get any oil out of
such whales as for that dried up one there he hasnt a gill in his
whole carcase

i know that well enough but dye see the captain here wont believe
it this is his first voyage he was a cologne manufacturer before but
come aboard and mayhap hell believe you if he wont me and so ill
get out of this dirty scrape

anything to oblige ye my sweet and pleasant fellow rejoined stubb
and with that he soon mounted to the deck there a queer scene presented
itself the sailors in tasselled caps of red worsted were getting the
heavy tackles in readiness for the whales but they worked rather slow
and talked very fast and seemed in anything but a good humor all their
noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jibbooms
now and then pairs of them would drop their work and run up to the
masthead to get some fresh air some thinking they would catch the
plague dipped oakum in coaltar and at intervals held it to their
nostrils others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short
off at the bowl were vigorously puffing tobaccosmoke so that it
constantly filled their olfactories

stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from
the captains roundhouse abaft and looking in that direction saw a
fiery face thrust from behind the door which was held ajar from within
this was the tormented surgeon who after in vain remonstrating
against the proceedings of the day had betaken himself to the captains
roundhouse cabinet he called it to avoid the pest but still could
not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times

marking all this stubb argued well for his scheme and turning to the
guernseyman had a little chat with him during which the stranger mate
expressed his detestation of his captain as a conceited ignoramus
who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle
sounding him carefully stubb further perceived that the guernseyman
had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris he therefore
held his peace on that head but otherwise was quite frank and
confidential with him so that the two quickly concocted a little plan
for both circumventing and satirizing the captain without his at all
dreaming of distrusting their sincerity according to this little plan
of theirs the guernseyman under cover of an interpreters office was
to tell the captain what he pleased but as coming from stubb and as
for stubb he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in
him during the interview

by this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin he was a
small and dark but rather delicate looking man for a seacaptain with
large whiskers and moustache however and wore a red cotton velvet vest
with watchseals at his side to this gentleman stubb was now politely
introduced by the guernseyman who at once ostentatiously put on the
aspect of interpreting between them

what shall i say to him first said he

why said stubb eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals you
may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me
though i dont pretend to be a judge

he says monsieur said the guernseyman in french turning to his
captain that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel whose captain
and chiefmate with six sailors had all died of a fever caught from a
blasted whale they had brought alongside

upon this the captain started and eagerly desired to know more

what now said the guernseyman to stubb

why since he takes it so easy tell him that now i have eyed him
carefully im quite certain that hes no more fit to command a
whaleship than a st jago monkey in fact tell him from me hes a
baboon

he vows and declares monsieur that the other whale the dried one is
far more deadly than the blasted one in fine monsieur he conjures us
as we value our lives to cut loose from these fish

instantly the captain ran forward and in a loud voice commanded his
crew to desist from hoisting the cuttingtackles and at once cast loose
the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship

what now said the guernseyman when the captain had returned to
them

why let me see yes you may as well tell him now thatthatin
fact tell him ive diddled him and aside to himself perhaps somebody
else

he says monsieur that hes very happy to have been of any service to
us

hearing this the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties
meaning himself and mate and concluded by inviting stubb down into his
cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux

he wants you to take a glass of wine with him said the interpreter

thank him heartily but tell him its against my principles to drink
with the man ive diddled in fact tell him i must go

he says monsieur that his principles wont admit of his drinking but
that if monsieur wants to live another day to drink then monsieur had
best drop all four boats and pull the ship away from these whales for
its so calm they wont drift

by this time stubb was over the side and getting into his boat hailed
the guernseyman to this effectthat having a long towline in his
boat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the lighter
whale of the two from the ships side while the frenchmans boats
then were engaged in towing the ship one way stubb benevolently towed
away at his whale the other way ostentatiously slacking out a most
unusually long towline

presently a breeze sprang up stubb feigned to cast off from the whale
hoisting his boats the frenchman soon increased his distance while the
pequod slid in between him and stubbs whale whereupon stubb quickly
pulled to the floating body and hailing the pequod to give notice of
his intentions at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous
cunning seizing his sharp boatspade he commenced an excavation in the
body a little behind the side fin you would almost have thought he was
digging a cellar there in the sea and when at length his spade struck
against the gaunt ribs it was like turning up old roman tiles and
pottery buried in fat english loam his boats crew were all in high
excitement eagerly helping their chief and looking as anxious as
goldhunters

and all the time numberless fowls were diving and ducking and
screaming and yelling and fighting around them stubb was beginning
to look disappointed especially as the horrible nosegay increased when
suddenly from out the very heart of this plague there stole a faint
stream of perfume which flowed through the tide of bad smells without
being absorbed by it as one river will flow into and then along with
another without at all blending with it for a time

i have it i have it cried stubb with delight striking something in
the subterranean regions a purse a purse

dropping his spade he thrust both hands in and drew out handfuls
of something that looked like ripe windsor soap or rich mottled old
cheese very unctuous and savory withal you might easily dent it with
your thumb it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour and this good
friends is ambergris worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist
some six handfuls were obtained but more was unavoidably lost in the
sea and still more perhaps might have been secured were it not for
impatient ahabs loud command to stubb to desist and come on board
else the ship would bid them good bye



chapter 92 ambergris


now this ambergris is a very curious substance and so important as
an article of commerce that in 1791 a certain nantucketborn captain
coffin was examined at the bar of the english house of commons on that
subject for at that time and indeed until a comparatively late day
the precise origin of ambergris remained like amber itself a problem
to the learned though the word ambergris is but the french compound for
grey amber yet the two substances are quite distinct for amber though
at times found on the seacoast is also dug up in some far inland
soils whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea besides
amber is a hard transparent brittle odorless substance used for
mouthpieces to pipes for beads and ornaments but ambergris is soft
waxy and so highly fragrant and spicy that it is largely used in
perfumery in pastiles precious candles hairpowders and pomatum
the turks use it in cooking and also carry it to mecca for the same
purpose that frankincense is carried to st peters in rome some wine
merchants drop a few grains into claret to flavor it

who would think then that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale
themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick
whale yet so it is by some ambergris is supposed to be the cause and
by others the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale how to cure such
a dyspepsia it were hard to say unless by administering three or four
boat loads of brandreths pills and then running out of harms way as
laborers do in blasting rocks

i have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris certain
hard round bony plates which at first stubb thought might be sailors
trowsers buttons but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing
more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner

now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be
found in the heart of such decay is this nothing bethink thee of that
saying of st paul in corinthians about corruption and incorruption
how that we are sown in dishonour but raised in glory and likewise
call to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh
the best musk also forget not the strange fact that of all things of
illsavor colognewater in its rudimental manufacturing stages is the
worst

i should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal but cannot
owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen
and which in the estimation of some already biased minds might be
considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of
the frenchmans two whales elsewhere in this volume the slanderous
aspersion has been disproved that the vocation of whaling is throughout
a slatternly untidy business but there is another thing to rebut they
hint that all whales always smell bad now how did this odious stigma
originate

i opine that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the
greenland whaling ships in london more than two centuries ago because
those whalemen did not then and do not now try out their oil at sea as
the southern ships have always done but cutting up the fresh blubber in
small bits thrust it through the bung holes of large casks and carry
it home in that manner the shortness of the season in those icy seas
and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed forbidding
any other course the consequence is that upon breaking into the hold
and unloading one of these whale cemeteries in the greenland dock a
savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an
old city graveyard for the foundations of a lyinginhospital

i partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whalers may be
likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland in former
times of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg which
latter name is the one used by the learned fogo von slack in his great
work on smells a textbook on that subject as its name imports smeer
fat berg to put up this village was founded in order to afford a
place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tried out without
being taken home to holland for that purpose it was a collection of
furnaces fatkettles and oil sheds and when the works were in full
operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor but all this is
quite different with a south sea sperm whaler which in a voyage of four
years perhaps after completely filling her hold with oil does not
perhaps consume fifty days in the business of boiling out and in the
state that it is casked the oil is nearly scentless the truth is that
living or dead if but decently treated whales as a species are by
no means creatures of ill odor nor can whalemen be recognised as the
people of the middle ages affected to detect a jew in the company by
the nose nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant
when as a general thing he enjoys such high health taking abundance
of exercise always out of doors though it is true seldom in the
open air i say that the motion of a sperm whales flukes above water
dispenses a perfume as when a muskscented lady rustles her dress in a
warm parlor what then shall i liken the sperm whale to for fragrance
considering his magnitude must it not be to that famous elephant with
jewelled tusks and redolent with myrrh which was led out of an indian
town to do honour to alexander the great



chapter 93 the castaway


it was but some few days after encountering the frenchman that a most
significant event befell the most insignificant of the pequods crew an
event most lamentable and which ended in providing the sometimes
madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying
prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own

now in the whale ship it is not every one that goes in the boats some
few hands are reserved called shipkeepers whose province it is to work
the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale as a general thing
these shipkeepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats
crews but if there happen to be an unduly slender clumsy or timorous
wight in the ship that wight is certain to be made a shipkeeper it
was so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by nickname pip by
abbreviation poor pip ye have heard of him before ye must remember
his tambourine on that dramatic midnight so gloomyjolly

in outer aspect pip and doughboy made a match like a black pony and a
white one of equal developments though of dissimilar colour driven in
one eccentric span but while hapless doughboy was by nature dull and
torpid in his intellects pip though over tenderhearted was at bottom
very bright with that pleasant genial jolly brightness peculiar to
his tribe a tribe which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with
finer freer relish than any other race for blacks the years calendar
should show naught but three hundred and sixtyfive fourth of julys and
new years days nor smile so while i write that this little black was
brilliant for even blackness has its brilliancy behold yon lustrous
ebony panelled in kings cabinets but pip loved life and all lifes
peaceable securities so that the panicstriking business in which he
had somehow unaccountably become entrapped had most sadly blurred his
brightness though as ere long will be seen what was thus temporarily
subdued in him in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by
strange wild fires that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the
natural lustre with which in his native tolland county in connecticut
he had once enlivened many a fiddlers frolic on the green and at
melodious eventide with his gay haha had turned the round horizon
into one starbelled tambourine so though in the clear air of day
suspended against a blueveined neck the purewatered diamond drop
will healthful glow yet when the cunning jeweller would show you
the diamond in its most impressive lustre he lays it against a gloomy
ground and then lights it up not by the sun but by some unnatural
gases then come out those fiery effulgences infernally superb then
the evilblazing diamond once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies
looks like some crownjewel stolen from the king of hell but let us to
the story

it came to pass that in the ambergris affair stubbs afteroarsman
chanced so to sprain his hand as for a time to become quite maimed
and temporarily pip was put into his place

the first time stubb lowered with him pip evinced much nervousness
but happily for that time escaped close contact with the whale and
therefore came off not altogether discreditably though stubb observing
him took care afterwards to exhort him to cherish his courageousness
to the utmost for he might often find it needful

now upon the second lowering the boat paddled upon the whale and as
the fish received the darted iron it gave its customary rap which
happened in this instance to be right under poor pips seat the
involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap paddle in
hand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whale
line coming against his chest he breasted it overboard with him so as
to become entangled in it when at last plumping into the water that
instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run the line swiftly
straightened and presto poor pip came all foaming up to the chocks
of the boat remorselessly dragged there by the line which had taken
several turns around his chest and neck

tashtego stood in the bows he was full of the fire of the hunt he
hated pip for a poltroon snatching the boatknife from its sheath
he suspended its sharp edge over the line and turning towards stubb
exclaimed interrogatively cut meantime pips blue choked face
plainly looked do for gods sake all passed in a flash in less than
half a minute this entire thing happened

damn him cut roared stubb and so the whale was lost and pip was
saved

so soon as he recovered himself the poor little negro was assailed
by yells and execrations from the crew tranquilly permitting these
irregular cursings to evaporate stubb then in a plain businesslike
but still half humorous manner cursed pip officially and that done
unofficially gave him much wholesome advice the substance was never
jump from a boat pip exceptbut all the rest was indefinite as the
soundest advice ever is now in general stick to the boat is your
true motto in whaling but cases will sometimes happen when leap from
the boat is still better moreover as if perceiving at last that if he
should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip he would be leaving
him too wide a margin to jump in for the future stubb suddenly dropped
all advice and concluded with a peremptory command stick to the boat
pip or by the lord i wont pick you up if you jump mind that we
cant afford to lose whales by the likes of you a whale would sell for
thirty times what you would pip in alabama bear that in mind and
dont jump any more hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted that
though man loved his fellow yet man is a moneymaking animal which
propensity too often interferes with his benevolence

but we are all in the hands of the gods and pip jumped again it was
under very similar circumstances to the first performance but this time
he did not breast out the line and hence when the whale started to
run pip was left behind on the sea like a hurried travellers trunk
alas stubb was but too true to his word it was a beautiful bounteous
blue day the spangled sea calm and cool and flatly stretching away
all round to the horizon like goldbeaters skin hammered out to the
extremest bobbing up and down in that sea pips ebon head showed
like a head of cloves no boatknife was lifted when he fell so rapidly
astern stubbs inexorable back was turned upon him and the whale was
winged in three minutes a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between
pip and stubb out from the centre of the sea poor pip turned his
crisp curling black head to the sun another lonely castaway though
the loftiest and the brightest

now in calm weather to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the
practised swimmer as to ride in a springcarriage ashore but the awful
lonesomeness is intolerable the intense concentration of self in the
middle of such a heartless immensity my god who can tell it mark how
when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open seamark how closely they
hug their ship and only coast along her sides

but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate no he
did not mean to at least because there were two boats in his wake
and he supposed no doubt that they would of course come up to pip very
quickly and pick him up though indeed such considerations towards
oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity is not always manifested
by the hunters in all similar instances and such instances not
unfrequently occur almost invariably in the fishery a coward so
called is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to
military navies and armies

but it so happened that those boats without seeing pip suddenly
spying whales close to them on one side turned and gave chase and
stubbs boat was now so far away and he and all his crew so intent
upon his fish that pips ringed horizon began to expand around him
miserably by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him but
from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot such at
least they said he was the sea had jeeringly kept his finite body
up but drowned the infinite of his soul not drowned entirely though
rather carried down alive to wondrous depths where strange shapes of
the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes
and the misermerman wisdom revealed his hoarded heaps and among the
joyous heartless everjuvenile eternities pip saw the multitudinous
godomnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters
heaved the colossal orbs he saw gods foot upon the treadle of the
loom and spoke it and therefore his shipmates called him mad so mans
insanity is heavens sense and wandering from all mortal reason man
comes at last to that celestial thought which to reason is absurd and
frantic and weal or woe feels then uncompromised indifferent as his
god

for the rest blame not stubb too hardly the thing is common in that
fishery and in the sequel of the narrative it will then be seen what
like abandonment befell myself



chapter 94 a squeeze of the hand


that whale of stubbs so dearly purchased was duly brought to
the pequods side where all those cutting and hoisting operations
previously detailed were regularly gone through even to the baling of
the heidelburgh tun or case

while some were occupied with this latter duty others were employed
in dragging away the larger tubs so soon as filled with the sperm and
when the proper time arrived this same sperm was carefully manipulated
ere going to the tryworks of which anon

it had cooled and crystallized to such a degree that when with several
others i sat down before a large constantines bath of it i found
it strangely concreted into lumps here and there rolling about in the
liquid part it was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid
a sweet and unctuous duty no wonder that in old times this sperm was
such a favourite cosmetic such a clearer such a sweetener such a
softener such a delicious molifier after having my hands in it for
only a few minutes my fingers felt like eels and began as it were to
serpentine and spiralise

as i sat there at my ease crosslegged on the deck after the bitter
exertion at the windlass under a blue tranquil sky the ship under
indolent sail and gliding so serenely along as i bathed my hands among
those soft gentle globules of infiltrated tissues woven almost within
the hour as they richly broke to my fingers and discharged all their
opulence like fully ripe grapes their wine as i snuffed up that
uncontaminated aromaliterally and truly like the smell of spring
violets i declare to you that for the time i lived as in a musky
meadow i forgot all about our horrible oath in that inexpressible
sperm i washed my hands and my heart of it i almost began to credit
the old paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying
the heat of anger while bathing in that bath i felt divinely free from
all illwill or petulance or malice of any sort whatsoever

squeeze squeeze squeeze all the morning long i squeezed that sperm
till i myself almost melted into it i squeezed that sperm till a
strange sort of insanity came over me and i found myself unwittingly
squeezing my colaborers hands in it mistaking their hands for the
gentle globules such an abounding affectionate friendly loving
feeling did this avocation beget that at last i was continually
squeezing their hands and looking up into their eyes sentimentally as
much as to sayoh my dear fellow beings why should we longer cherish
any social acerbities or know the slightest illhumor or envy come
let us squeeze hands all round nay let us all squeeze ourselves into
each other let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and
sperm of kindness

would that i could keep squeezing that sperm for ever for now since by
many prolonged repeated experiences i have perceived that in all cases
man must eventually lower or at least shift his conceit of attainable
felicity not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy but in
the wife the heart the bed the table the saddle the fireside the
country now that i have perceived all this i am ready to squeeze case
eternally in thoughts of the visions of the night i saw long rows of
angels in paradise each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti

now while discoursing of sperm it behooves to speak of other things
akin to it in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the
tryworks

first comes whitehorse so called which is obtained from the tapering
part of the fish and also from the thicker portions of his flukes it
is tough with congealed tendonsa wad of musclebut still contains
some oil after being severed from the whale the whitehorse is first
cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer they look much like
blocks of berkshire marble

plumpudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the
whales flesh here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber and
often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness it is
a most refreshing convivial beautiful object to behold as its name
imports it is of an exceedingly rich mottled tint with a bestreaked
snowy and golden ground dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and
purple it is plums of rubies in pictures of citron spite of reason
it is hard to keep yourself from eating it i confess that once i stole
behind the foremast to try it it tasted something as i should conceive
a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros might have tasted
supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison
season and that particular venison season contemporary with an
unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of champagne

there is another substance and a very singular one which turns up in
the course of this business but which i feel it to be very puzzling
adequately to describe it is called slobgollion an appellation
original with the whalemen and even so is the nature of the substance
it is an ineffably oozy stringy affair most frequently found in the
tubs of sperm after a prolonged squeezing and subsequent decanting
i hold it to be the wondrously thin ruptured membranes of the case
coalescing

gurry so called is a term properly belonging to right whalemen but
sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen it designates the
dark glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the greenland
or right whale and much of which covers the decks of those inferior
souls who hunt that ignoble leviathan

nippers strictly this word is not indigenous to the whales vocabulary
but as applied by whalemen it becomes so a whalemans nipper is
a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of
leviathans tail it averages an inch in thickness and for the rest is
about the size of the iron part of a hoe edgewise moved along the
oily deck it operates like a leathern squilgee and by nameless
blandishments as of magic allures along with it all impurities

but to learn all about these recondite matters your best way is at once
to descend into the blubberroom and have a long talk with its inmates
this place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the
blanketpieces when stript and hoisted from the whale when the proper
time arrives for cutting up its contents this apartment is a scene of
terror to all tyros especially by night on one side lit by a dull
lantern a space has been left clear for the workmen they generally
go in pairsa pikeandgaffman and a spademan the whalingpike is
similar to a frigates boardingweapon of the same name the gaff is
something like a boathook with his gaff the gaffman hooks on to a
sheet of blubber and strives to hold it from slipping as the ship
pitches and lurches about meanwhile the spademan stands on the sheet
itself perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horsepieces this
spade is sharp as hone can make it the spademans feet are shoeless
the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from
him like a sledge if he cuts off one of his own toes or one of his
assistants would you be very much astonished toes are scarce among
veteran blubberroom men



chapter 95 the cassock


had you stepped on board the pequod at a certain juncture of this
postmortemizing of the whale and had you strolled forward nigh the
windlass pretty sure am i that you would have scanned with no small
curiosity a very strange enigmatical object which you would have seen
there lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers not the wondrous
cistern in the whales huge head not the prodigy of his unhinged lower
jaw not the miracle of his symmetrical tail none of these would so
surprise you as half a glimpse of that unaccountable conelonger than
a kentuckian is tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base and jetblack
as yojo the ebony idol of queequeg and an idol indeed it is or
rather in old times its likeness was such an idol as that found in
the secret groves of queen maachah in judea and for worshipping which
king asa her son did depose her and destroyed the idol and burnt it
for an abomination at the brook kedron as darkly set forth in the 15th
chapter of the first book of kings

look at the sailor called the mincer who now comes along and assisted
by two allies heavily backs the grandissimus as the mariners call it
and with bowed shoulders staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier
carrying a dead comrade from the field extending it upon the forecastle
deck he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt as an
african hunter the pelt of a boa this done he turns the pelt inside
out like a pantaloon leg gives it a good stretching so as almost to
double its diameter and at last hangs it well spread in the rigging
to dry ere long it is taken down when removing some three feet of it
towards the pointed extremity and then cutting two slits for armholes
at the other end he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it the mincer
now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling
immemorial to all his order this investiture alone will adequately
protect him while employed in the peculiar functions of his office

that office consists in mincing the horsepieces of blubber for the
pots an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse planted
endwise against the bulwarks and with a capacious tub beneath it into
which the minced pieces drop fast as the sheets from a rapt orators
desk arrayed in decent black occupying a conspicuous pulpit intent
on bible leaves what a candidate for an archbishopric what a lad for a
pope were this mincer


bible leaves bible leaves this is the invariable cry from the mates
to the mincer it enjoins him to be careful and cut his work into as
thin slices as possible inasmuch as by so doing the business of
boiling out the oil is much accelerated and its quantity considerably
increased besides perhaps improving it in quality



chapter 96 the tryworks


besides her hoisted boats an american whaler is outwardly distinguished
by her tryworks she presents the curious anomaly of the most solid
masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship
it is as if from the open field a brickkiln were transported to her
planks

the tryworks are planted between the foremast and mainmast the most
roomy part of the deck the timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength
fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and
mortar some ten feet by eight square and five in height the
foundation does not penetrate the deck but the masonry is firmly
secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all
sides and screwing it down to the timbers on the flanks it is cased
with wood and at top completely covered by a large sloping battened
hatchway removing this hatch we expose the great trypots two in
number and each of several barrels capacity when not in use they are
kept remarkably clean sometimes they are polished with soapstone
and sand till they shine within like silver punchbowls during the
nightwatches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil
themselves away there for a nap while employed in polishing themone
man in each pot side by sidemany confidential communications
are carried on over the iron lips it is a place also for profound
mathematical meditation it was in the left hand trypot of the pequod
with the soapstone diligently circling round me that i was first
indirectly struck by the remarkable fact that in geometry all bodies
gliding along the cycloid my soapstone for example will descend from
any point in precisely the same time

removing the fireboard from the front of the tryworks the bare
masonry of that side is exposed penetrated by the two iron mouths of
the furnaces directly underneath the pots these mouths are fitted
with heavy doors of iron the intense heat of the fire is prevented
from communicating itself to the deck by means of a shallow reservoir
extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works by a tunnel
inserted at the rear this reservoir is kept replenished with water as
fast as it evaporates there are no external chimneys they open direct
from the rear wall and here let us go back for a moment

it was about nine oclock at night that the pequods tryworks were
first started on this present voyage it belonged to stubb to oversee
the business

all ready there off hatch then and start her you cook fire the
works this was an easy thing for the carpenter had been thrusting his
shavings into the furnace throughout the passage here be it said that
in a whaling voyage the first fire in the tryworks has to be fed for a
time with wood after that no wood is used except as a means of quick
ignition to the staple fuel in a word after being tried out the
crisp shrivelled blubber now called scraps or fritters still contains
considerable of its unctuous properties these fritters feed the flames
like a plethoric burning martyr or a selfconsuming misanthrope once
ignited the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body
would that he consumed his own smoke for his smoke is horrible to
inhale and inhale it you must and not only that but you must live in
it for the time it has an unspeakable wild hindoo odor about it such
as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres it smells like the left
wing of the day of judgment it is an argument for the pit

by midnight the works were in full operation we were clear from the
carcase sail had been made the wind was freshening the wild ocean
darkness was intense but that darkness was licked up by the fierce
flames which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues and
illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging as with the famed greek
fire the burning ship drove on as if remorselessly commissioned to
some vengeful deed so the pitch and sulphurfreighted brigs of the
bold hydriote canaris issuing from their midnight harbors with broad
sheets of flame for sails bore down upon the turkish frigates and
folded them in conflagrations

the hatch removed from the top of the works now afforded a wide hearth
in front of them standing on this were the tartarean shapes of the
pagan harpooneers always the whaleships stokers with huge pronged
poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots or
stirred up the fires beneath till the snaky flames darted curling out
of the doors to catch them by the feet the smoke rolled away in sullen
heaps to every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil
which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces opposite the mouth
of the works on the further side of the wide wooden hearth was the
windlass this served for a seasofa here lounged the watch when not
otherwise employed looking into the red heat of the fire till their
eyes felt scorched in their heads their tawny features now all
begrimed with smoke and sweat their matted beards and the contrasting
barbaric brilliancy of their teeth all these were strangely revealed in
the capricious emblazonings of the works as they narrated to each other
their unholy adventures their tales of terror told in words of mirth
as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them like the
flames from the furnace as to and fro in their front the harpooneers
wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers as the
wind howled on and the sea leaped and the ship groaned and dived and
yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness
of the sea and the night and scornfully champed the white bone in
her mouth and viciously spat round her on all sides then the rushing
pequod freighted with savages and laden with fire and burning
a corpse and plunging into that blackness of darkness seemed the
material counterpart of her monomaniac commanders soul

so seemed it to me as i stood at her helm and for long hours silently
guided the way of this fireship on the sea wrapped for that interval
in darkness myself i but the better saw the redness the madness the
ghastliness of others the continual sight of the fiend shapes before
me capering half in smoke and half in fire these at last begat kindred
visions in my soul so soon as i began to yield to that unaccountable
drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm

but that night in particular a strange and ever since inexplicable
thing occurred to me starting from a brief standing sleep i was
horribly conscious of something fatally wrong the jawbone tiller smote
my side which leaned against it in my ears was the low hum of sails
just beginning to shake in the wind i thought my eyes were open i
was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically
stretching them still further apart but spite of all this i could see
no compass before me to steer by though it seemed but a minute since i
had been watching the card by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it
nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom now and then made ghastly by
flashes of redness uppermost was the impression that whatever swift
rushing thing i stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as
rushing from all havens astern a stark bewildered feeling as of
death came over me convulsively my hands grasped the tiller but with
the crazy conceit that the tiller was somehow in some enchanted way
inverted my god what is the matter with me thought i lo in my brief
sleep i had turned myself about and was fronting the ships stern with
my back to her prow and the compass in an instant i faced back just
in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind and very
probably capsizing her how glad and how grateful the relief from this
unnatural hallucination of the night and the fatal contingency of being
brought by the lee

look not too long in the face of the fire o man never dream with thy
hand on the helm turn not thy back to the compass accept the first
hint of the hitching tiller believe not the artificial fire when its
redness makes all things look ghastly tomorrow in the natural sun
the skies will be bright those who glared like devils in the forking
flames the morn will show in far other at least gentler relief the
glorious golden glad sun the only true lampall others but liars

nevertheless the sun hides not virginias dismal swamp nor romes
accursed campagna nor wide sahara nor all the millions of miles of
deserts and of griefs beneath the moon the sun hides not the ocean
which is the dark side of this earth and which is two thirds of this
earth so therefore that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow
in him that mortal man cannot be truenot true or undeveloped with
books the same the truest of all men was the man of sorrows and the
truest of all books is solomons and ecclesiastes is the fine hammered
steel of woe all is vanity all this wilful world hath not got hold
of unchristian solomons wisdom yet but he who dodges hospitals and
jails and walks fast crossing graveyards and would rather talk of
operas than hell calls cowper young pascal rousseau poor devils all
of sick men and throughout a carefree lifetime swears by rabelais as
passing wise and therefore jollynot that man is fitted to sit
down on tombstones and break the green damp mould with unfathomably
wondrous solomon

but even solomon he says the man that wandereth out of the way
of understanding shall remain ie even while living in the
congregation of the dead give not thyself up then to fire lest it
invert thee deaden thee as for the time it did me there is a wisdom
that is woe but there is a woe that is madness and there is a catskill
eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges
and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces
and even if he for ever flies within the gorge that gorge is in the
mountains so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still
higher than other birds upon the plain even though they soar



chapter 97 the lamp


had you descended from the pequods tryworks to the pequods
forecastle where the off duty watch were sleeping for one single
moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some
illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors there they lay
in their triangular oaken vaults each mariner a chiselled muteness a
score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes

in merchantmen oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of
queens to dress in the dark and eat in the dark and stumble in
darkness to his pallet this is his usual lot but the whaleman as he
seeks the food of light so he lives in light he makes his berth an
aladdins lamp and lays him down in it so that in the pitchiest night
the ships black hull still houses an illumination

see with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of
lampsoften but old bottles and vials thoughto the copper cooler at
the tryworks and replenishes them there as mugs of ale at a vat he
burns too the purest of oil in its unmanufactured and therefore
unvitiated state a fluid unknown to solar lunar or astral
contrivances ashore it is sweet as early grass butter in april he
goes and hunts for his oil so as to be sure of its freshness and
genuineness even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own
supper of game



chapter 98 stowing down and clearing up


already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off
descried from the masthead how he is chased over the watery moors and
slaughtered in the valleys of the deep how he is then towed alongside
and beheaded and how on the principle which entitled the headsman of
old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed his great padded
surtout becomes the property of his executioner how in due time he
is condemned to the pots and like shadrach meshach and abednego his
spermaceti oil and bone pass unscathed through the firebut now it
remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by
rehearsingsinging if i maythe romantic proceeding of decanting off
his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold where
once again leviathan returns to his native profundities sliding along
beneath the surface as before but alas never more to rise and blow

while still warm the oil like hot punch is received into the
sixbarrel casks and while perhaps the ship is pitching and rolling
this way and that in the midnight sea the enormous casks are slewed
round and headed over end for end and sometimes perilously scoot
across the slippery deck like so many land slides till at last
manhandled and stayed in their course and all round the hoops rap
rap go as many hammers as can play upon them for now ex officio
every sailor is a cooper

at length when the last pint is casked and all is cool then the great
hatchways are unsealed the bowels of the ship are thrown open and down
go the casks to their final rest in the sea this done the hatches are
replaced and hermetically closed like a closet walled up

in the sperm fishery this is perhaps one of the most remarkable
incidents in all the business of whaling one day the planks stream with
freshets of blood and oil on the sacred quarterdeck enormous masses of
the whales head are profanely piled great rusty casks lie about as
in a brewery yard the smoke from the tryworks has besooted all the
bulwarks the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness the entire
ship seems great leviathan himself while on all hands the din is
deafening

but a day or two after you look about you and prick your ears in this
selfsame ship and were it not for the telltale boats and tryworks
you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel with a
most scrupulously neat commander the unmanufactured sperm oil possesses
a singularly cleansing virtue this is the reason why the decks never
look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil besides
from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale a potent lye is
readily made and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale
remains clinging to the side that lye quickly exterminates it hands
go diligently along the bulwarks and with buckets of water and rags
restore them to their full tidiness the soot is brushed from the lower
rigging all the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise
faithfully cleansed and put away the great hatch is scrubbed and placed
upon the tryworks completely hiding the pots every cask is out of
sight all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks and when by the combined
and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ships company the
whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded then the crew
themselves proceed to their own ablutions shift themselves from top to
toe and finally issue to the immaculate deck fresh and all aglow as
bridegrooms newleaped from out the daintiest holland

now with elated step they pace the planks in twos and threes and
humorously discourse of parlors sofas carpets and fine cambrics
propose to mat the deck think of having hanging to the top object not
to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle to hint to
such musked mariners of oil and bone and blubber were little short
of audacity they know not the thing you distantly allude to away and
bring us napkins

but mark aloft there at the three mast heads stand three men intent
on spying out more whales which if caught infallibly will again
soil the old oaken furniture and drop at least one small greasespot
somewhere yes and many is the time when after the severest
uninterrupted labors which know no night continuing straight through
for ninetysix hours when from the boat where they have swelled their
wrists with all day rowing on the linethey only step to the deck to
carry vast chains and heave the heavy windlass and cut and slash yea
and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined
fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial tryworks when on the
heel of all this they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the
ship and make a spotless dairy room of it many is the time the poor
fellows just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks are startled by
the cry of there she blows and away they fly to fight another whale
and go through the whole weary thing again oh my friends but this
is mankilling yet this is life for hardly have we mortals by long
toilings extracted from this worlds vast bulk its small but valuable
sperm and then with weary patience cleansed ourselves from its
defilements and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul
hardly is this done whenthere she blowsthe ghost is spouted up
and away we sail to fight some other world and go through young lifes
old routine again

oh the metempsychosis oh pythagoras that in bright greece two
thousand years ago did die so good so wise so mild i sailed with
thee along the peruvian coast last voyageand foolish as i am taught
thee a green simple boy how to splice a rope



chapter 99 the doubloon


ere now it has been related how ahab was wont to pace his quarterdeck
taking regular turns at either limit the binnacle and mainmast but
in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been
added how that sometimes in these walks when most plunged in his mood
he was wont to pause in turn at each spot and stand there strangely
eyeing the particular object before him when he halted before the
binnacle with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass
that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his
purpose and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast
then as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin
there he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness only dashed
with a certain wild longing if not hopefulness

but one morning turning to pass the doubloon he seemed to be newly
attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it as
though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in
some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them and some
certain significance lurks in all things else all things are little
worth and the round world itself but an empty cipher except to sell by
the cartload as they do hills about boston to fill up some morass in
the milky way

now this doubloon was of purest virgin gold raked somewhere out of the
heart of gorgeous hills whence east and west over golden sands the
headwaters of many a pactolus flows and though now nailed amidst all
the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes yet
untouchable and immaculate to any foulness it still preserved its quito
glow nor though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed
by ruthless hands and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick
darkness which might cover any pilfering approach nevertheless every
sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last for it was
set apart and sanctified to one awestriking end and however wanton
in their sailor ways one and all the mariners revered it as the white
whales talisman sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by
night wondering whose it was to be at last and whether he would ever
live to spend it

now those noble golden coins of south america are as medals of the sun
and tropic tokenpieces here palms alpacas and volcanoes suns disks
and stars ecliptics hornsofplenty and rich banners waving are in
luxuriant profusion stamped so that the precious gold seems almost to
derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories by passing through
those fancy mints so spanishly poetic

it so chanced that the doubloon of the pequod was a most wealthy example
of these things on its round border it bore the letters republica del
ecuador quito so this bright coin came from a country planted in the
middle of the world and beneath the great equator and named after it
and it had been cast midway up the andes in the unwaning clime that
knows no autumn zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three
andes summits from one a flame a tower on another on the third a
crowing cock while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned
zodiac the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics and the
keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at libra

before this equatorial coin ahab not unobserved by others was now
pausing

theres something ever egotistical in mountaintops and towers and
all other grand and lofty things look herethree peaks as proud as
lucifer the firm tower that is ahab the volcano that is ahab the
courageous the undaunted and victorious fowl that too is ahab all
are ahab and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe
which like a magicians glass to each and every man in turn but
mirrors back his own mysterious self great pains small gains for those
who ask the world to solve them it cannot solve itself methinks now
this coined sun wears a ruddy face but see aye he enters the sign
of storms the equinox and but six months before he wheeled out of a
former equinox at aries from storm to storm so be it then born in
throes t is fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs so be
it then heres stout stuff for woe to work on so be it then

no fairy fingers can have pressed the gold but devils claws must
have left their mouldings there since yesterday murmured starbuck
to himself leaning against the bulwarks the old man seems to read
belshazzars awful writing i have never marked the coin inspectingly
he goes below let me read a dark valley between three mighty
heavenabiding peaks that almost seem the trinity in some faint
earthly symbol so in this vale of death god girds us round and over
all our gloom the sun of righteousness still shines a beacon and a
hope if we bend down our eyes the dark vale shows her mouldy soil
but if we lift them the bright sun meets our glance half way to cheer
yet oh the great sun is no fixture and if at midnight we would fain
snatch some sweet solace from him we gaze for him in vain this coin
speaks wisely mildly truly but still sadly to me i will quit it
lest truth shake me falsely

there nows the old mogul soliloquized stubb by the tryworks hes
been twigging it and there goes starbuck from the same and both with
faces which i should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long
and all from looking at a piece of gold which did i have it now on
negro hill or in corlaers hook id not look at it very long ere
spending it humph in my poor insignificant opinion i regard this as
queer i have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings your doubloons
of old spain your doubloons of peru your doubloons of chili your
doubloons of bolivia your doubloons of popayan with plenty of gold
moidores and pistoles and joes and half joes and quarter joes what
then should there be in this doubloon of the equator that is so killing
wonderful by golconda let me read it once halloa heres signs and
wonders truly that now is what old bowditch in his epitome calls the
zodiac and what my almanac below calls ditto ill get the almanac and
as i have heard devils can be raised with dabolls arithmetic ill try
my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with
the massachusetts calendar heres the book lets see now signs and
wonders and the sun hes always among em hem hem hem here they

bare words and facts but we come in to supply the thoughts thats my
small experience so far as the massachusetts calendar and bowditchs
navigator and dabolls arithmetic go signs and wonders eh pity if
there is nothing wonderful in signs and significant in wonders theres
a clue somewhere wait a bit histhark by jove i have it look you

himself as we pluck out the shafts stand aside heres the
batteringram capricornus or the goat full tilt he comes rushing
and headlong we are tossed when aquarius or the waterbearer pours
out his whole deluge and drowns us and to wind up with pisces or the
fishes we sleep theres a sermon now writ in high heaven and the
sun goes through it every year and yet comes out of it all alive and
hearty jollily he aloft there wheels through toil and trouble and
so alow here does jolly stubb oh jollys the word for aye adieu

tryworks now and lets hear what hell have to say there hes
before it hell out with something presently so so hes beginning

i see nothing here but a round thing made of gold and whoever raises
a certain whale this round thing belongs to him so whats all this
staring been about it is worth sixteen dollars thats true and at
two cents the cigar thats nine hundred and sixty cigars i wont smoke

foolish look to it yet if it be really foolish then has it a sort
of wiseish look to it but avast here comes our old manxmanthe old
hearsedriver he must have been that is before he took to the sea he
luffs up before the doubloon halloa and goes round on the other side
of the mast why theres a horseshoe nailed on that side and now hes
back again what does that mean hark hes mutteringvoice like an old
wornout coffeemill prick ears and listen

if the white whale be raised it must be in a month and a day when
the sun stands in some one of these signs ive studied signs and know
their marks they were taught me two score years ago by the old witch
in copenhagen now in what sign will the sun then be the horseshoe
sign for there it is right opposite the gold and whats the
horseshoe sign the lion is the horseshoe signthe roaring and
devouring lion ship old ship my old head shakes to think of thee

chapter 100 leg and arm

the pequod of nantucket meets the samuel enderby of london


ship ahoy hast seen the white whale

so cried ahab once more hailing a ship showing english colours bearing
down under the stern trumpet to mouth the old man was standing in his
hoisted quarterboat his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger
captain who was carelessly reclining in his own boats bow he was
a darklytanned burly goodnatured finelooking man of sixty or
thereabouts dressed in a spacious roundabout that hung round him in
festoons of blue pilotcloth and one empty arm of this jacket streamed
behind him like the broidered arm of a hussars surcoat

hast seen the white whale

see you this and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it
he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone terminating in a wooden head
like a mallet

man my boat cried ahab impetuously and tossing about the oars near
himstand by to lower

in less than a minute without quitting his little craft he and his
crew were dropped to the water and were soon alongside of the stranger
but here a curious difficulty presented itself in the excitement of the
moment ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never
once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own and then it was
always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to
the pequod and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other
vessel at a moments warning now it is no very easy matter
for anybodyexcept those who are almost hourly used to it like
whalemento clamber up a ships side from a boat on the open sea for
the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks and
then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson so deprived
of one leg and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied
with the kindly invention ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a
clumsy landsman again hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height
he could hardly hope to attain

it has before been hinted perhaps that every little untoward
circumstance that befell him and which indirectly sprang from his
luckless mishap almost invariably irritated or exasperated ahab and
in the present instance all this was heightened by the sight of the
two officers of the strange ship leaning over the side by the
perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there and swinging towards him a
pair of tastefullyornamented manropes for at first they did not seem
to bethink them that a onelegged man must be too much of a cripple to
use their sea bannisters but this awkwardness only lasted a minute
because the strange captain observing at a glance how affairs stood
cried out i see i seeavast heaving there jump boys and swing
over the cuttingtackle

as good luck would have it they had had a whale alongside a day or two
previous and the great tackles were still aloft and the massive curved
blubberhook now clean and dry was still attached to the end this
was quickly lowered to ahab who at once comprehending it all slid his
solitary thigh into the curve of the hook it was like sitting in the
fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple tree and then giving the
word held himself fast and at the same time also helped to hoist his
own weight by pulling handoverhand upon one of the running parts of
the tackle soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks and
gently landed upon the capstan head with his ivory arm frankly thrust
forth in welcome the other captain advanced and ahab putting out his
ivory leg and crossing the ivory arm like two swordfish blades
cried out in his walrus way aye aye hearty let us shake bones
togetheran arm and a legan arm that never can shrink dye
see and a leg that never can run where didst thou see the white
whalehow long ago

the white whale said the englishman pointing his ivory arm towards
the east and taking a rueful sight along it as if it had been a
telescope there i saw him on the line last season

and he took that arm off did he asked ahab now sliding down from
the capstan and resting on the englishmans shoulder as he did so

aye he was the cause of it at least and that leg too

spin me the yarn said ahab how was it

it was the first time in my life that i ever cruised on the line
began the englishman i was ignorant of the white whale at that time
well one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales and my boat
fastened to one of them a regular circus horse he was too that went
milling and milling round so that my boats crew could only trim dish
by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale presently up breaches
from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale with a milkywhite
head and hump all crows feet and wrinkles

it was he it was he cried ahab suddenly letting out his suspended
breath

and harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin

aye ayethey were minemy irons cried ahab exultinglybut on

give me a chance then said the englishman goodhumoredly well
this old greatgrandfather with the white head and hump runs all afoam
into the pod and goes to snapping furiously at my fastline

aye i seewanted to part it free the fastfishan old tricki
know him

how it was exactly continued the onearmed commander i do not know
but in biting the line it got foul of his teeth caught there somehow
but we didnt know it then so that when we afterwards pulled on the
line bounce we came plump on to his hump instead of the other whales
that went off to windward all fluking seeing how matters stood and
what a noble great whale it wasthe noblest and biggest i ever saw
sir in my lifei resolved to capture him spite of the boiling rage
he seemed to be in and thinking the haphazard line would get loose or
the tooth it was tangled to might draw for i have a devil of a boats
crew for a pull on a whaleline seeing all this i say i jumped
into my first mates boatmr mounttops here by the way
captainmounttop mounttopthe captainas i was saying i jumped
into mounttops boat which dye see was gunwale and gunwale
with mine then and snatching the first harpoon let this old
greatgrandfather have it but lord look you sirhearts and souls
alive manthe next instant in a jiff i was blind as a batboth
eyes outall befogged and bedeadened with black foamthe whales tail
looming straight up out of it perpendicular in the air like a marble
steeple no use sterning all then but as i was groping at midday with
a blinding sun all crownjewels as i was groping i say after the
second iron to toss it overboarddown comes the tail like a lima
tower cutting my boat in two leaving each half in splinters and
flukes first the white hump backed through the wreck as though it was
all chips we all struck out to escape his terrible flailings i seized
hold of my harpoonpole sticking in him and for a moment clung to that
like a sucking fish but a combing sea dashed me off and at the same
instant the fish taking one good dart forwards went down like a
flash and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me
caught me here clapping his hand just below his shoulder yes
caught me just here i say and bore me down to hells flames i was
thinking when when all of a sudden thank the good god the barb ript
its way along the fleshclear along the whole length of my armcame
out nigh my wrist and up i floatedand that gentleman there will tell
you the rest by the way captaindr bunger ships surgeon bunger
my ladthe captain now bunger boy spin your part of the yarn

the professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out had been all the
time standing near them with nothing specific visible to denote his
gentlemanly rank on board his face was an exceedingly round but sober
one he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt and patched
trowsers and had thus far been dividing his attention between a
marlingspike he held in one hand and a pillbox held in the other
occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two
crippled captains but at his superiors introduction of him to ahab
he politely bowed and straightway went on to do his captains bidding

it was a shocking bad wound began the whalesurgeon and taking my
advice captain boomer here stood our old sammy

samuel enderby is the name of my ship interrupted the onearmed
captain addressing ahab go on boy

stood our old sammy off to the northward to get out of the blazing hot
weather there on the line but it was no usei did all i could sat up
with him nights was very severe with him in the matter of diet

oh very severe chimed in the patient himself then suddenly altering
his voice drinking hot rum toddies with me every night till he
couldnt see to put on the bandages and sending me to bed half seas
over about three oclock in the morning oh ye stars he sat up with
me indeed and was very severe in my diet oh a great watcher and very
dietetically severe is dr bunger bunger you dog laugh out why
dont ye you know youre a precious jolly rascal but heave ahead
boy id rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man

my captain you must have ere this perceived respected sirsaid the
imperturbable godlylooking bunger slightly bowing to ahabis apt to
be facetious at times he spins us many clever things of that sort but
i may as well sayen passant as the french remarkthat i myselfthat
is to say jack bunger late of the reverend clergyam a strict total
abstinence man i never drink

water cried the captain he never drinks it its a sort of fits to
him fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia but go ongo on with
the arm story

yes i may as well said the surgeon coolly i was about observing
sir before captain boomers facetious interruption that spite of my
best and severest endeavors the wound kept getting worse and worse the
truth was sir it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw more
than two feet and several inches long i measured it with the lead line
in short it grew black i knew what was threatened and off it came
but i had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there that thing is
against all rulepointing at it with the marlingspikethat is the
captains work not mine he ordered the carpenter to make it he had
that clubhammer there put to the end to knock some ones brains
out with i suppose as he tried mine once he flies into diabolical
passions sometimes do ye see this dent sirremoving his hat and
brushing aside his hair and exposing a bowllike cavity in his skull
but which bore not the slightest scarry trace or any token of ever
having been a woundwell the captain there will tell you how that
came here he knows

no i dont said the captain but his mother did he was born with
it oh you solemn rogue youyou bunger was there ever such another
bunger in the watery world bunger when you die you ought to die in
pickle you dog you should be preserved to future ages you rascal

what became of the white whale now cried ahab who thus far had been
impatiently listening to this byplay between the two englishmen

oh cried the onearmed captain oh yes well after he sounded
we didnt see him again for some time in fact as i before hinted i
didnt then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick till
some time afterwards when coming back to the line we heard about moby
dickas some call himand then i knew it was he

didst thou cross his wake again

twice

but could not fasten

didnt want to try to aint one limb enough what should i do without
this other arm and im thinking moby dick doesnt bite so much as he
swallows

well then interrupted bunger give him your left arm for bait to
get the right do you know gentlemenvery gravely and mathematically
bowing to each captain in successiondo you know gentlemen that the
digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divine
providence that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest
even a mans arm and he knows it too so that what you take for the
white whales malice is only his awkwardness for he never means
to swallow a single limb he only thinks to terrify by feints but
sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow formerly a patient of mine
in ceylon that making believe swallow jackknives once upon a time let
one drop into him in good earnest and there it stayed for a twelvemonth
or more when i gave him an emetic and he heaved it up in small tacks
dye see no possible way for him to digest that jackknife and fully
incorporate it into his general bodily system yes captain boomer if
you are quick enough about it and have a mind to pawn one arm for the
sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other why in that
case the arm is yours only let the whale have another chance at you
shortly thats all

no thank ye bunger said the english captain hes welcome to the
arm he has since i cant help it and didnt know him then but not to
another one no more white whales for me ive lowered for him once and
that has satisfied me there would be great glory in killing him i know
that and there is a shipload of precious sperm in him but hark ye
hes best let alone dont you think so captainglancing at the
ivory leg

he is but he will still be hunted for all that what is best let
alone that accursed thing is not always what least allures hes all a
magnet how long since thou sawst him last which way heading

bless my soul and curse the foul fiends cried bunger stoopingly
walking round ahab and like a dog strangely snuffing this mans
bloodbring the thermometerits at the boiling pointhis pulse
makes these planks beatsirtaking a lancet from his pocket and
drawing near to ahabs arm

avast roared ahab dashing him against the bulwarksman the boat
which way heading

good god cried the english captain to whom the question was put
whats the matter he was heading east i thinkis your captain
crazy whispering fedallah

but fedallah putting a finger on his lip slid over the bulwarks to
take the boats steering oar and ahab swinging the cuttingtackle
towards him commanded the ships sailors to stand by to lower

in a moment he was standing in the boats stern and the manilla men
were springing to their oars in vain the english captain hailed him
with back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to his own
ahab stood upright till alongside of the pequod



chapter 101 the decanter


ere the english ship fades from sight be it set down here that
she hailed from london and was named after the late samuel enderby
merchant of that city the original of the famous whaling house of
enderby  sons a house which in my poor whalemans opinion comes not
far behind the united royal houses of the tudors and bourbons in point
of real historical interest how long prior to the year of our
lord 1775 this great whaling house was in existence my numerous
fishdocuments do not make plain but in that year 1775 it fitted
out the first english ships that ever regularly hunted the sperm whale
though for some score of years previous ever since 1726 our valiant
coffins and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard had in large fleets
pursued that leviathan but only in the north and south atlantic not
elsewhere be it distinctly recorded here that the nantucketers were
the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm
whale and that for half a century they were the only people of the
whole globe who so harpooned him

in 1778 a fine ship the amelia fitted out for the express purpose
and at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys boldly rounded cape
horn and was the first among the nations to lower a whaleboat of any
sort in the great south sea the voyage was a skilful and lucky one
and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm the
amelias example was soon followed by other ships english and american
and thus the vast sperm whale grounds of the pacific were thrown open
but not content with this good deed the indefatigable house again
bestirred itself samuel and all his sonshow many their mother only
knowsand under their immediate auspices and partly i think at their
expense the british government was induced to send the sloopofwar
rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the south sea commanded
by a naval postcaptain the rattler made a rattling voyage of it and
did some service how much does not appear but this is not all in
1819 the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own to
go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of japan that shipwell
called the syrenmade a noble experimental cruise and it was thus
that the great japanese whaling ground first became generally known
the syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a captain coffin a
nantucketer

all honour to the enderbies therefore whose house i think exists to
the present day though doubtless the original samuel must long ago have
slipped his cable for the great south sea of the other world

the ship named after him was worthy of the honour being a very fast
sailer and a noble craft every way i boarded her once at midnight
somewhere off the patagonian coast and drank good flip down in the
forecastle it was a fine gam we had and they were all trumpsevery
soul on board a short life to them and a jolly death and that fine
gam i hadlong very long after old ahab touched her planks with his
ivory heelit minds me of the noble solid saxon hospitality of that
ship and may my parson forget me and the devil remember me if i ever
lose sight of it flip did i say we had flip yes and we flipped it
at the rate of ten gallons the hour and when the squall came for its
squally off there by patagonia and all handsvisitors and allwere
called to reef topsails we were so topheavy that we had to swing each
other aloft in bowlines and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our
jackets into the sails so that we hung there reefed fast in the
howling gale a warning example to all drunken tars however the masts
did not go overboard and by and by we scrambled down so sober that we
had to pass the flip again though the savage salt spray bursting down
the forecastle scuttle rather too much diluted and pickled it to my
taste

the beef was finetough but with body in it they said it was
bullbeef others that it was dromedary beef but i do not know for
certain how that was they had dumplings too small but substantial
symmetrically globular and indestructible dumplings i fancied that you
could feel them and roll them about in you after they were swallowed
if you stooped over too far forward you risked their pitching out
of you like billiardballs the breadbut that couldnt be helped
besides it was an antiscorbutic in short the bread contained the
only fresh fare they had but the forecastle was not very light and it
was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it but all
in all taking her from truck to helm considering the dimensions of the
cooks boilers including his own live parchment boilers fore and aft
i say the samuel enderby was a jolly ship of good fare and plenty
fine flip and strong crack fellows all and capital from boot heels to
hatband

but why was it think ye that the samuel enderby and some other
english whalers i know ofnot all thoughwere such famous hospitable
ships that passed round the beef and the bread and the can and the
joke and were not soon weary of eating and drinking and laughing
i will tell you the abounding good cheer of these english whalers
is matter for historical research nor have i been at all sparing of
historical whale research when it has seemed needed

the english were preceded in the whale fishery by the hollanders
zealanders and danes from whom they derived many terms still extant
in the fishery and what is yet more their fat old fashions
touching plenty to eat and drink for as a general thing the english
merchantship scrimps her crew but not so the english whaler hence in
the english this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural
but incidental and particular and therefore must have some special
origin which is here pointed out and will be still further elucidated

during my researches in the leviathanic histories i stumbled upon an
ancient dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of it i
knew must be about whalers the title was dan coopman wherefore i
concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some amsterdam
cooper in the fishery as every whale ship must carry its cooper i was
reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one
fitz swackhammer but my friend dr snodhead a very learned man
professor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa claus and
st potts to whom i handed the work for translation giving him a box
of sperm candles for his troublethis same dr snodhead so soon as he
spied the book assured me that dan coopman did not mean the cooper
but the merchant in short this ancient and learned low dutch book
treated of the commerce of holland and among other subjects contained
a very interesting account of its whale fishery and in this chapter it
was headed smeer or fat that i found a long detailed list of the
outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of dutch whalemen from
which list as translated by dr snodhead i transcribe the following

400000 lbs of beef 60000 lbs friesland pork 150000 lbs of stock
fish 550000 lbs of biscuit 72000 lbs of soft bread 2800 firkins
of butter 20000 lbs texel  leyden cheese 144000 lbs cheese
probably an inferior article 550 ankers of geneva 10800 barrels of
beer

most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading not so in
the present case however where the reader is flooded with whole pipes
barrels quarts and gills of good gin and good cheer

at the time i devoted three days to the studious digesting of all
this beer beef and bread during which many profound thoughts were
incidentally suggested to me capable of a transcendental and platonic
application and furthermore i compiled supplementary tables of my
own touching the probable quantity of stockfish etc consumed by
every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen
whale fishery in the first place the amount of butter and texel and
leyden cheese consumed seems amazing i impute it though to their
naturally unctuous natures being rendered still more unctuous by the
nature of their vocation and especially by their pursuing their game
in those frigid polar seas on the very coasts of that esquimaux country
where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil

the quantity of beer too is very large 10800 barrels now as those
polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that
climate so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemen
including the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea did not much
exceed three months say and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet
of 180 sail we have 5400 low dutch seamen in all therefore i say
we have precisely two barrels of beer per man for a twelve weeks
allowance exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin
now whether these gin and beer harpooneers so fuddled as one might
fancy them to have been were the right sort of men to stand up in
a boats head and take good aim at flying whales this would seem
somewhat improbable yet they did aim at them and hit them too but
this was very far north be it remembered where beer agrees well with
the constitution upon the equator in our southern fishery beer would
be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the masthead and boozy in his
boat and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford

but no more enough has been said to show that the old dutch whalers
of two or three centuries ago were high livers and that the english
whalers have not neglected so excellent an example for say they when
cruising in an empty ship if you can get nothing better out of the
world get a good dinner out of it at least and this empties the
decanter



chapter 102 a bower in the arsacides


hitherto in descriptively treating of the sperm whale i have chiefly
dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect or separately and in detail
upon some few interior structural features but to a large and thorough
sweeping comprehension of him it behooves me now to unbutton him still
further and untagging the points of his hose unbuckling his garters
and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost
bones set him before you in his ultimatum that is to say in his
unconditional skeleton

but how now ishmael how is it that you a mere oarsman in the
fishery pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the
whale did erudite stubb mounted upon your capstan deliver lectures
on the anatomy of the cetacea and by help of the windlass hold up a
specimen rib for exhibition explain thyself ishmael can you land
a fullgrown whale on your deck for examination as a cook dishes a
roastpig surely not a veritable witness have you hitherto been
ishmael but have a care how you seize the privilege of jonah alone
the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams the rafters
ridgepole sleepers and underpinnings making up the framework of
leviathan and belike of the tallowvats dairyrooms butteries and
cheeseries in his bowels

i confess that since jonah few whalemen have penetrated very far
beneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless i have been blessed
with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature in a ship i belonged
to a small cub sperm whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his
poke or bag to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons and for the
heads of the lances think you i let that chance go without using my
boathatchet and jackknife and breaking the seal and reading all the
contents of that young cub

and as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their
gigantic full grown development for that rare knowledge i am indebted
to my late royal friend tranquo king of tranque one of the arsacides
for being at tranque years ago when attached to the tradingship dey
of algiers i was invited to spend part of the arsacidean holidays with
the lord of tranque at his retired palm villa at pupella a seaside
glen not very far distant from what our sailors called bambootown his
capital

among many other fine qualities my royal friend tranquo being gifted
with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu had brought
together in pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his
people could invent chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices
chiselled shells inlaid spears costly paddles aromatic canoes
and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders the
wonderfreighted tributerendering waves had cast upon his shores

chief among these latter was a great sperm whale which after an
unusually long raging gale had been found dead and stranded with his
head against a cocoanut tree whose plumagelike tufted droopings
seemed his verdant jet when the vast body had at last been stripped of
its fathomdeep enfoldings and the bones become dust dry in the sun
then the skeleton was carefully transported up the pupella glen where a
grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it

the ribs were hung with trophies the vertebrae were carved with
arsacidean annals in strange hieroglyphics in the skull the priests
kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystic head
again sent forth its vapoury spout while suspended from a bough the
terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees like the hairhung
sword that so affrighted damocles

it was a wondrous sight the wood was green as mosses of the icy
glen the trees stood high and haughty feeling their living sap the
industrious earth beneath was as a weavers loom with a gorgeous carpet
on it whereof the groundvine tendrils formed the warp and woof and
the living flowers the figures all the trees with all their laden
branches all the shrubs and ferns and grasses the messagecarrying
air all these unceasingly were active through the lacings of the
leaves the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied
verdure oh busy weaver unseen weaverpauseone wordwhither
flows the fabric what palace may it deck wherefore all these ceaseless
toilings speak weaverstay thy handbut one single word with
thee naythe shuttle fliesthe figures float from forth the loom the
freshetrushing carpet for ever slides away the weavergod he weaves
and by that weaving is he deafened that he hears no mortal voice and
by that humming we too who look on the loom are deafened and only
when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through
it for even so it is in all material factories the spoken words that
are inaudible among the flying spindles those same words are plainly
heard without the walls bursting from the opened casements thereby
have villainies been detected ah mortal then be heedful for so in
all this din of the great worlds loom thy subtlest thinkings may be
overheard afar

now amid the green liferestless loom of that arsacidean wood the
great white worshipped skeleton lay lounginga gigantic idler yet
as the everwoven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around
him the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver himself all woven
over with the vines every month assuming greener fresher verdure but
himself a skeleton life folded death death trellised life the grim
god wived with youthful life and begat him curlyheaded glories

now when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale and saw the
skull an altar and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real
jet had issued i marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as
an object of vertu he laughed but more i marvelled that the priests
should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine to and fro i paced
before this skeletonbrushed the vines asidebroke through the
ribsand with a ball of arsacidean twine wandered eddied long amid
its many winding shaded colonnades and arbours but soon my line was
out and following it back i emerged from the opening where i entered
i saw no living thing within naught was there but bones

cutting me a green measuringrod i once more dived within the skeleton
from their arrowslit in the skull the priests perceived me taking the
altitude of the final rib how now they shouted darst thou measure
this our god thats for us aye priestswell how long do ye make
him then but hereupon a fierce contest rose among them concerning
feet and inches they cracked each others sconces with their
yardsticksthe great skull echoedand seizing that lucky chance i
quickly concluded my own admeasurements

these admeasurements i now propose to set before you but first be
it recorded that in this matter i am not free to utter any fancied
measurement i please because there are skeleton authorities you can
refer to to test my accuracy there is a leviathanic museum they tell
me in hull england one of the whaling ports of that country where
they have some fine specimens of finbacks and other whales likewise i
have heard that in the museum of manchester in new hampshire they have
what the proprietors call the only perfect specimen of a greenland or
river whale in the united states moreover at a place in yorkshire
england burton constable by name a certain sir clifford constable has
in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale but of moderate size
by no means of the fullgrown magnitude of my friend king tranquos

in both cases the stranded whales to which these two skeletons
belonged were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar
grounds king tranquo seizing his because he wanted it and sir
clifford because he was lord of the seignories of those parts sir
cliffords whale has been articulated throughout so that like a
great chest of drawers you can open and shut him in all his bony
cavitiesspread out his ribs like a gigantic fanand swing all day
upon his lower jaw locks are to be put upon some of his trapdoors and
shutters and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of
keys at his side sir clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at
the whispering gallery in the spinal column threepence to hear the echo
in the hollow of his cerebellum and sixpence for the unrivalled view
from his forehead

the skeleton dimensions i shall now proceed to set down are copied
verbatim from my right arm where i had them tattooed as in my wild
wanderings at that period there was no other secure way of preserving
such valuable statistics but as i was crowded for space and wished
the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i was
then composingat least what untattooed parts might remaini did not
trouble myself with the odd inches nor indeed should inches at all
enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale



chapter 103 measurement of the whales skeleton


in the first place i wish to lay before you a particular plain
statement touching the living bulk of this leviathan whose skeleton we
are briefly to exhibit such a statement may prove useful here

according to a careful calculation i have made and which i partly base
upon captain scoresbys estimate of seventy tons for the largest
sized greenland whale of sixty feet in length according to my careful
calculation i say a sperm whale of the largest magnitude between
eightyfive and ninety feet in length and something less than forty
feet in its fullest circumference such a whale will weigh at least
ninety tons so that reckoning thirteen men to a ton he would
considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one
thousand one hundred inhabitants

think you not then that brains like yoked cattle should be put to this
leviathan to make him at all budge to any landsmans imagination

having already in various ways put before you his skull spouthole
jaw teeth tail forehead fins and divers other parts i shall now
simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his
unobstructed bones but as the colossal skull embraces so very large
a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton as it is by far the
most complicated part and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in
this chapter you must not fail to carry it in your mind or under your
arm as we proceed otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the
general structure we are about to view

in length the sperm whales skeleton at tranque measured seventytwo
feet so that when fully invested and extended in life he must have
been ninety feet long for in the whale the skeleton loses about one
fifth in length compared with the living body of this seventytwo feet
his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet leaving some fifty feet of
plain backbone attached to this backbone for something less than a
third of its length was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once
enclosed his vitals

to me this vast ivoryribbed chest with the long unrelieved spine
extending far away from it in a straight line not a little resembled
the hull of a great ship newlaid upon the stocks when only some twenty
of her naked bowribs are inserted and the keel is otherwise for the
time but a long disconnected timber

the ribs were ten on a side the first to begin from the neck
was nearly six feet long the second third and fourth were each
successively longer till you came to the climax of the fifth or one
of the middle ribs which measured eight feet and some inches from
that part the remaining ribs diminished till the tenth and last only
spanned five feet and some inches in general thickness they all bore
a seemly correspondence to their length the middle ribs were the most
arched in some of the arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay
footpath bridges over small streams

in considering these ribs i could not but be struck anew with the
circumstance so variously repeated in this book that the skeleton of
the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form the largest of
the tranque ribs one of the middle ones occupied that part of the fish
which in life is greatest in depth now the greatest depth of the
invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen
feet whereas the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight
feet so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the
living magnitude of that part besides for some way where i now saw
but a naked spine all that had been once wrapped round with tons of
added bulk in flesh muscle blood and bowels still more for the
ample fins i here saw but a few disordered joints and in place of the
weighty and majestic but boneless flukes an utter blank

how vain and foolish then thought i for timid untravelled man to try
to comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely poring over his dead
attenuated skeleton stretched in this peaceful wood no only in the
heart of quickest perils only when within the eddyings of his angry
flukes only on the profound unbounded sea can the fully invested whale
be truly and livingly found out

but the spine for that the best way we can consider it is with a
crane to pile its bones high up on end no speedy enterprise but now
its done it looks much like pompeys pillar

there are forty and odd vertebrae in all which in the skeleton are
not locked together they mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on
a gothic spire forming solid courses of heavy masonry the largest
a middle one is in width something less than three feet and in depth
more than four the smallest where the spine tapers away into the
tail is only two inches in width and looks something like a white
billiardball i was told that there were still smaller ones but they
had been lost by some little cannibal urchins the priests children
who had stolen them to play marbles with thus we see how that the
spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple
childs play



chapter 104 the fossil whale


from his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon
to enlarge amplify and generally expatiate would you you could not
compress him by good rights he should only be treated of in imperial
folio not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail
and the yards he measures about the waist only think of the gigantic
involutions of his intestines where they lie in him like great
cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlopdeck of a
lineofbattleship

since i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan it behooves me
to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise not
overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood and spinning him
out to the uttermost coil of his bowels having already described him
in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities it
now remains to magnify him in an archaeological fossiliferous and
antediluvian point of view applied to any other creature than the
leviathanto an ant or a fleasuch portly terms might justly be deemed
unwarrantably grandiloquent but when leviathan is the text the case is
altered fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest
words of the dictionary and here be it said that whenever it has been
convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations i have
invariably used a huge quarto edition of johnson expressly purchased
for that purpose because that famous lexicographers uncommon personal
bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author
like me

one often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject
though it may seem but an ordinary one how then with me writing
of this leviathan unconsciously my chirography expands into placard
capitals give me a condors quill give me vesuvius crater for an
inkstand friends hold my arms for in the mere act of penning my
thoughts of this leviathan they weary me and make me faint with their
outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep as if to include the whole
circle of the sciences and all the generations of whales and men and
mastodons past present and to come with all the revolving panoramas
of empire on earth and throughout the whole universe not excluding its
suburbs such and so magnifying is the virtue of a large and liberal
theme we expand to its bulk to produce a mighty book you must choose
a mighty theme no great and enduring volume can ever be written on the
flea though many there be who have tried it

ere entering upon the subject of fossil whales i present my credentials
as a geologist by stating that in my miscellaneous time i have been
a stonemason and also a great digger of ditches canals and wells
winevaults cellars and cisterns of all sorts likewise by way of
preliminary i desire to remind the reader that while in the earlier
geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost
completely extinct the subsequent relics discovered in what are called
the tertiary formations seem the connecting or at any rate intercepted
links between the antichronical creatures and those whose remote
posterity are said to have entered the ark all the fossil whales
hitherto discovered belong to the tertiary period which is the last
preceding the superficial formations and though none of them
precisely answer to any known species of the present time they are yet
sufficiently akin to them in general respects to justify their taking
rank as cetacean fossils

detached broken fossils of preadamite whales fragments of their bones
and skeletons have within thirty years past at various intervals been
found at the base of the alps in lombardy in france in england in
scotland and in the states of louisiana mississippi and alabama
among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull which in the
year 1779 was disinterred in the rue dauphine in paris a short street
opening almost directly upon the palace of the tuileries and bones
disinterred in excavating the great docks of antwerp in napoleons
time cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly
unknown leviathanic species

but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almost
complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster found in the year 1842 on
the plantation of judge creagh in alabama the awestricken credulous
slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen
angels the alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile and bestowed
upon it the name of basilosaurus but some specimen bones of it being
taken across the sea to owen the english anatomist it turned out
that this alleged reptile was a whale though of a departed species a
significant illustration of the fact again and again repeated in this
book that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the
shape of his fully invested body so owen rechristened the monster
zeuglodon and in his paper read before the london geological society
pronounced it in substance one of the most extraordinary creatures
which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence

when i stand among these mighty leviathan skeletons skulls tusks
jaws ribs and vertebrae all characterized by partial resemblances to
the existing breeds of seamonsters but at the same time bearing on
the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical
leviathans their incalculable seniors i am by a flood borne back
to that wondrous period ere time itself can be said to have begun
for time began with man here saturns grey chaos rolls over me and i
obtain dim shuddering glimpses into those polar eternities when wedged
bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropics and in
all the 25000 miles of this worlds circumference not an inhabitable
hands breadth of land was visible then the whole world was the
whales and king of creation he left his wake along the present lines
of the andes and the himmalehs who can show a pedigree like leviathan
ahabs harpoon had shed older blood than the pharaohs methuselah seems
a schoolboy i look round to shake hands with shem i am horrorstruck
at this antemosaic unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of
the whale which having been before all time must needs exist after
all humane ages are over

but not alone has this leviathan left his preadamite traces in the
stereotype plates of nature and in limestone and marl bequeathed his
ancient bust but upon egyptian tablets whose antiquity seems to claim
for them an almost fossiliferous character we find the unmistakable
print of his fin in an apartment of the great temple of denderah
some fifty years ago there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a
sculptured and painted planisphere abounding in centaurs griffins and
dolphins similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the
moderns gliding among them old leviathan swam as of yore was there
swimming in that planisphere centuries before solomon was cradled

nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity
of the whale in his own osseous postdiluvian reality as set down by
the venerable john leo the old barbary traveller

not far from the seaside they have a temple the rafters and beams
of which are made of whalebones for whales of a monstrous size are
oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore the common people imagine that
by a secret power bestowed by god upon the temple no whale can pass it
without immediate death but the truth of the matter is that on either
side of the temple there are rocks that shoot two miles into the sea
and wound the whales when they light upon em they keep a whales rib
of an incredible length for a miracle which lying upon the ground with
its convex part uppermost makes an arch the head of which cannot be
reached by a man upon a camels back this rib says john leo is said
to have layn there a hundred years before i saw it their historians
affirm that a prophet who prophesyd of mahomet came from this temple
and some do not stand to assert that the prophet jonas was cast forth
by the whale at the base of the temple

in this afric temple of the whale i leave you reader and if you be a
nantucketer and a whaleman you will silently worship there



chapter 105 does the whales magnitude diminishwill he perish


inasmuch then as this leviathan comes floundering down upon us from
the headwaters of the eternities it may be fitly inquired whether
in the long course of his generations he has not degenerated from the
original bulk of his sires

but upon investigation we find that not only are the whales of the
present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are
found in the tertiary system embracing a distinct geological period
prior to man but of the whales found in that tertiary system those
belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier
ones

of all the preadamite whales yet exhumed by far the largest is the
alabama one mentioned in the last chapter and that was less than
seventy feet in length in the skeleton whereas we have already seen
that the tapemeasure gives seventytwo feet for the skeleton of a large
sized modern whale and i have heard on whalemens authority that
sperm whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of
capture

but may it not be that while the whales of the present hour are an
advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods may
it not be that since adams time they have degenerated

assuredly we must conclude so if we are to credit the accounts of such
gentlemen as pliny and the ancient naturalists generally for pliny
tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk and aldrovandus
of others which measured eight hundred feet in lengthrope walks and
thames tunnels of whales and even in the days of banks and solander
cookes naturalists we find a danish member of the academy of sciences
setting down certain iceland whales reydansiskur or wrinkled bellies
at one hundred and twenty yards that is three hundred and sixty feet
and lacepede the french naturalist in his elaborate history of whales
in the very beginning of his work page 3 sets down the right whale at
one hundred metres three hundred and twentyeight feet and this work
was published so late as ad 1825

but will any whaleman believe these stories no the whale of today is
as big as his ancestors in plinys time and if ever i go where pliny
is i a whaleman more than he was will make bold to tell him so
because i cannot understand how it is that while the egyptian mummies
that were buried thousands of years before even pliny was born do not
measure so much in their coffins as a modern kentuckian in his socks
and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest egyptian
and nineveh tablets by the relative proportions in which they are
drawn just as plainly prove that the highbred stallfed prize cattle
of smithfield not only equal but far exceed in magnitude the fattest
of pharaohs fat kine in the face of all this i will not admit that of
all animals the whale alone should have degenerated

but still another inquiry remains one often agitated by the more
recondite nantucketers whether owing to the almost omniscient lookouts
at the mastheads of the whaleships now penetrating even through
behrings straits and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers
of the world and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all
continental coasts the moot point is whether leviathan can long endure
so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc whether he must not at last
be exterminated from the waters and the last whale like the last man
smoke his last pipe and then himself evaporate in the final puff

comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo
which not forty years ago overspread by tens of thousands the prairies
of illinois and missouri and shook their iron manes and scowled with
their thunderclotted brows upon the sites of populous rivercapitals
where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch in such
a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished to show that
the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction

but you must look at this matter in every light though so short a
period agonot a good lifetimethe census of the buffalo in illinois
exceeded the census of men now in london and though at the present day
not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region and though the
cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man yet the far
different nature of the whalehunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an
end to the leviathan forty men in one ship hunting the sperm whales for
fortyeight months think they have done extremely well and thank god
if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish whereas in the days
of the old canadian and indian hunters and trappers of the west when
the far west in whose sunset suns still rise was a wilderness and
a virgin the same number of moccasined men for the same number of
months mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships would have slain
not forty but forty thousand and more buffaloes a fact that if need
were could be statistically stated

nor considered aright does it seem any argument in favour of the
gradual extinction of the sperm whale for example that in former years
the latter part of the last century say these leviathans in
small pods were encountered much oftener than at present and in
consequence the voyages were not so prolonged and were also much more
remunerative because as has been elsewhere noticed those whales
influenced by some views to safety now swim the seas in immense
caravans so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries yokes and
pods and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely
separated unfrequent armies that is all and equally fallacious seems
the conceit that because the socalled whalebone whales no longer
haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them hence that
species also is declining for they are only being driven from
promontory to cape and if one coast is no longer enlivened with
their jets then be sure some other and remoter strand has been very
recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle

furthermore concerning these last mentioned leviathans they have two
firm fortresses which in all human probability will for ever remain
impregnable and as upon the invasion of their valleys the frosty swiss
have retreated to their mountains so hunted from the savannas and
glades of the middle seas the whalebone whales can at last resort to
their polar citadels and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and
walls there come up among icy fields and floes and in a charmed circle
of everlasting december bid defiance to all pursuit from man

but as perhaps fifty of these whalebone whales are harpooned for one
cachalot some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this
positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions
but though for some time past a number of these whales not less than
13000 have been annually slain on the norwest coast by the americans
alone yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance
of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter

natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness
of the more enormous creatures of the globe yet what shall we say to
harto the historian of goa when he tells us that at one hunting the
king of siam took 4000 elephants that in those regions elephants are
numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes and there seems no
reason to doubt that if these elephants which have now been hunted for
thousands of years by semiramis by porus by hannibal and by all the
successive monarchs of the eastif they still survive there in great
numbers much more may the great whale outlast all hunting since he
has a pasture to expatiate in which is precisely twice as large as all
asia both americas europe and africa new holland and all the isles
of the sea combined

moreover we are to consider that from the presumed great longevity
of whales their probably attaining the age of a century and more
therefore at any one period of time several distinct adult generations
must be contemporary and what that is we may soon gain some idea
of by imagining all the graveyards cemeteries and family vaults of
creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men women and children
who were alive seventyfive years ago and adding this countless host to
the present human population of the globe

wherefore for all these things we account the whale immortal in his
species however perishable in his individuality he swam the seas
before the continents broke water he once swam over the site of the
tuileries and windsor castle and the kremlin in noahs flood he
despised noahs ark and if ever the world is to be again flooded like
the netherlands to kill off its rats then the eternal whale will still
survive and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood
spout his frothed defiance to the skies



chapter 106 ahabs leg


the precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quitted the samuel
enderby of london had not been unattended with some small violence to
his own person he had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his
boat that his ivory leg had received a halfsplintering shock and
when after gaining his own deck and his own pivothole there he so
vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman it
was as ever something about his not steering inflexibly enough then
the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench
that though it still remained entire and to all appearances lusty yet
ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy

and indeed it seemed small matter for wonder that for all his
pervading mad recklessness ahab did at times give careful heed to the
condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood for it had not
been very long prior to the pequods sailing from nantucket that he
had been found one night lying prone upon the ground and insensible
by some unknown and seemingly inexplicable unimaginable casualty his
ivory limb having been so violently displaced that it had stakewise
smitten and all but pierced his groin nor was it without extreme
difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured

nor at the time had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind that all
the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a
former woe and he too plainly seemed to see that as the most poisonous
reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest
songster of the grove so equally with every felicity all miserable
events do naturally beget their like yea more than equally thought
ahab since both the ancestry and posterity of grief go further than the
ancestry and posterity of joy for not to hint of this that it is
an inference from certain canonic teachings that while some natural
enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world
but on the contrary shall be followed by the joychildlessness of
all hells despair whereas some guilty mortal miseries shall still
fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs
beyond the grave not at all to hint of this there still seems an
inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing for thought ahab while
even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying
pettiness lurking in them but at bottom all heartwoes a mystic
significance and in some men an archangelic grandeur so do their
diligent tracingsout not belie the obvious deduction to trail the
genealogies of these high mortal miseries carries us at last among the
sourceless primogenitures of the gods so that in the face of all the
glad haymaking suns and soft cymballing round harvestmoons we must
needs give in to this that the gods themselves are not for ever glad
the ineffaceable sad birthmark in the brow of man is but the stamp of
sorrow in the signers

unwittingly here a secret has been divulged which perhaps might more
properly in set way have been disclosed before with many other
particulars concerning ahab always had it remained a mystery to some
why it was that for a certain period both before and after the sailing
of the pequod he had hidden himself away with such grandlamalike
exclusiveness and for that one interval sought speechless refuge as
it were among the marble senate of the dead captain pelegs bruited
reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate though indeed
as touching all ahabs deeper part every revelation partook more of
significant darkness than of explanatory light but in the end it all
came out this one matter did at least that direful mishap was at
the bottom of his temporary recluseness and not only this but to that
evercontracting dropping circle ashore who for any reason possessed
the privilege of a less banned approach to him to that timid circle the
above hinted casualtyremaining as it did moodily unaccounted for by
ahabinvested itself with terrors not entirely underived from the land
of spirits and of wails so that through their zeal for him they had
all conspired so far as in them lay to muffle up the knowledge of
this thing from others and hence it was that not till a considerable
interval had elapsed did it transpire upon the pequods decks

but be all this as it may let the unseen ambiguous synod in the air
or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire have to do or not
with earthly ahab yet in this present matter of his leg he took plain
practical procedureshe called the carpenter

and when that functionary appeared before him he bade him without delay
set about making a new leg and directed the mates to see him supplied
with all the studs and joists of jawivory sperm whale which had thus
far been accumulated on the voyage in order that a careful selection
of the stoutest clearestgrained stuff might be secured this done the
carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night and to
provide all the fittings for it independent of those pertaining to
the distrusted one in use moreover the ships forge was ordered to be
hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold and to accelerate
the affair the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the
forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed



chapter 107 the carpenter


seat thyself sultanically among the moons of saturn and take high
abstracted man alone and he seems a wonder a grandeur and a woe but
from the same point take mankind in mass and for the most part they
seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates both contemporary and hereditary
but most humble though he was and far from furnishing an example of
the high humane abstraction the pequods carpenter was no duplicate
hence he now comes in person on this stage

like all seagoing ship carpenters and more especially those belonging
to whaling vessels he was to a certain offhanded practical extent
alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own
the carpenters pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all
those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an
auxiliary material but besides the application to him of the generic
remark above this carpenter of the pequod was singularly efficient in
those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring
in a large ship upon a three or four years voyage in uncivilized
and fardistant seas for not to speak of his readiness in ordinary
dutiesrepairing stove boats sprung spars reforming the shape of
clumsybladed oars inserting bulls eyes in the deck or new treenails
in the side planks and other miscellaneous matters more directly
pertaining to his special business he was moreover unhesitatingly
expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes both useful and
capricious

the one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold
was his vicebench a long rude ponderous table furnished with several
vices of different sizes and both of iron and of wood at all times
except when whales were alongside this bench was securely lashed
athwartships against the rear of the tryworks

a belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole
the carpenter claps it into one of his everready vices and straightway
files it smaller a lost landbird of strange plumage strays on board
and is made a captive out of clean shaved rods of rightwhale bone and
crossbeams of sperm whale ivory the carpenter makes a pagodalooking
cage for it an oarsman sprains his wrist the carpenter concocts a
soothing lotion stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon
the blade of his every oar screwing each oar in his big vice of wood
the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation a sailor takes
a fancy to wear sharkbone earrings the carpenter drills his ears
another has the toothache the carpenter out pincers and clapping
one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there but the poor fellow
unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation whirling round the
handle of his wooden vice the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in
that if he would have him draw the tooth

thus this carpenter was prepared at all points and alike indifferent
and without respect in all teeth he accounted bits of ivory heads he
deemed but topblocks men themselves he lightly held for capstans but
while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such
liveliness of expertness in him too all this would seem to argue some
uncommon vivacity of intelligence but not precisely so for nothing was
this man more remarkable than for a certain impersonal stolidity as
it were impersonal i say for it so shaded off into the surrounding
infinite of things that it seemed one with the general stolidity
discernible in the whole visible world which while pauselessly active
in uncounted modes still eternally holds its peace and ignores you
though you dig foundations for cathedrals yet was this halfhorrible
stolidity in him involving too as it appeared an allramifying
heartlessnessyet was it oddly dashed at times with an old
crutchlike antediluvian wheezing humorousness not unstreaked now
and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such as might have served
to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle
of noahs ark was it that this old carpenter had been a lifelong
wanderer whose much rolling to and fro not only had gathered no moss
but what is more had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings
might have originally pertained to him he was a stript abstract an
unfractioned integral uncompromised as a newborn babe living without
premeditated reference to this world or the next you might almost
say that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of
unintelligence for in his numerous trades he did not seem to work so
much by reason or by instinct or simply because he had been tutored to
it or by any intermixture of all these even or uneven but merely by
a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literal process he was a pure
manipulator his brain if he had ever had one must have early
oozed along into the muscles of his fingers he was like one of
those unreasoning but still highly useful multum in parvo sheffield
contrivances assuming the exteriorthough a little swelledof a
common pocket knife but containing not only blades of various sizes
but also screwdrivers corkscrews tweezers awls pens rulers
nailfilers countersinkers so if his superiors wanted to use the
carpenter for a screwdriver all they had to do was to open that part
of him and the screw was fast or if for tweezers take him up by the
legs and there they were

yet as previously hinted this omnitooled openandshut carpenter
was after all no mere machine of an automaton if he did not have a
common soul in him he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously
did its duty what that was whether essence of quicksilver or a few
drops of hartshorn there is no telling but there it was and there it
had abided for now some sixty years or more and this it was this same
unaccountable cunning lifeprinciple in him this it was that kept
him a great part of the time soliloquizing but only like an unreasoning
wheel which also hummingly soliloquizes or rather his body was a
sentrybox and this soliloquizer on guard there and talking all the
time to keep himself awake



chapter 108 ahab and the carpenter

the deckfirst night watch


carpenter standing before his vicebench and by the light of two
lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg which joist is
firmly fixed in the vice slabs of ivory leather straps pads screws
and various tools of all sorts lying about the bench forward the red
flame of the forge is seen where the blacksmith is at work


drat the file and drat the bone that is hard which should be soft
and that is soft which should be hard so we go who file old jaws and
shinbones lets try another aye now this works better sneezes
halloa this bone dust is sneezeswhy its sneezesyes its
sneezesbless my soul it wont let me speak this is what an old
fellow gets now for working in dead lumber saw a live tree and
you dont get this dust amputate a live bone and you dont get it
sneezes come come you old smut there bear a hand and lets have
that ferule and bucklescrew ill be ready for them presently lucky
now sneezes theres no kneejoint to make that might puzzle a little
but a mere shinbonewhy its easy as making hoppoles only i should
like to put a good finish on time time if i but only had the time i
could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever sneezes scraped to a lady
in a parlor those buckskin legs and calves of legs ive seen in shop
windows wouldnt compare at all they soak water they do and of
course get rheumatic and have to be doctored sneezes with washes and
lotions just like live legs there before i saw it off now i must
call his old mogulship and see whether the length will be all right
too short if anything i guess ha thats the heel we are in luck
here he comes or its somebody else thats certain

ahab advancing

during the ensuing scene the carpenter continues sneezing at times


well manmaker

just in time sir if the captain pleases i will now mark the length
let me measure sir

measured for a leg good well its not the first time about it
there keep thy finger on it this is a cogent vice thou hast here
carpenter let me feel its grip once so so it does pinch some

oh sir it will break bonesbeware beware

no fear i like a good grip i like to feel something in this
slippery world that can hold man whats prometheus about therethe
blacksmith i meanwhats he about

he must be forging the bucklescrew sir now

right its a partnership he supplies the muscle part he makes a
fierce red flame there

aye sir he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work

umm so he must i do deem it now a most meaning thing that that
old greek prometheus who made men they say should have been a
blacksmith and animated them with fire for whats made in fire must
properly belong to fire and so hells probable how the soot flies
this must be the remainder the greek made the africans of carpenter
when hes through with that buckle tell him to forge a pair of steel
shoulderblades theres a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack

sir

hold while prometheus is about it ill order a complete man after a
desirable pattern imprimis fifty feet high in his socks then chest
modelled after the thames tunnel then legs with roots to em to stay
in one place then arms three feet through the wrist no heart at all
brass forehead and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains and let
me seeshall i order eyes to see outwards no but put a skylight on
top of his head to illuminate inwards there take the order and away

now whats he speaking about and whos he speaking to i should like
to know shall i keep standing here aside

tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome heres one no
no no i must have a lantern

ho ho thats it hey here are two sir one will serve my turn

what art thou thrusting that thiefcatcher into my face for man
thrusted light is worse than presented pistols

i thought sir that you spoke to carpenter


carpenter why thatsbut noa very tidy and i may say
an extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here
carpenteror wouldst thou rather work in clay

sirclay clay sir thats mud we leave clay to ditchers sir

the fellows impious what art thou sneezing about

bone is rather dusty sir

take the hint then and when thou art dead never bury thyself under
living peoples noses

siroh ahi guess soyesdear

look ye carpenter i dare say thou callest thyself a right good
workmanlike workman eh well then will it speak thoroughly well
for thy work if when i come to mount this leg thou makest i shall
nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it that
is carpenter my old lost leg the flesh and blood one i mean canst
thou not drive that old adam away

truly sir i begin to understand somewhat now yes i have heard
something curious on that score sir how that a dismasted man never
entirely loses the feeling of his old spar but it will be still
pricking him at times may i humbly ask if it be really so sir

it is man look put thy live leg here in the place where mine once
was so now here is only one distinct leg to the eye yet two to the
soul where thou feelest tingling life there exactly there there to a
hair do i ist a riddle

i should humbly call it a poser sir

hist then how dost thou know that some entire living thinking thing
may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where
thou now standest aye and standing there in thy spite in thy most
solitary hours then dost thou not fear eavesdroppers hold dont
speak and if i still feel the smart of my crushed leg though it be now
so long dissolved then why mayst not thou carpenter feel the fiery
pains of hell for ever and without a body hah

good lord truly sir if it comes to that i must calculate over again
i think i didnt carry a small figure sir

look ye puddingheads should never grant premiseshow long before the
leg is done

perhaps an hour sir

bungle away at it then and bring it to me turns to go oh life here
i am proud as greek god and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for
a bone to stand on cursed be that mortal interindebtedness which will
not do away with ledgers i would be free as air and im down in the
whole worlds books i am so rich i could have given bid for bid with
the wealthiest praetorians at the auction of the roman empire which was
the worlds and yet i owe for the flesh in the tongue i brag with by
heavens ill get a crucible and into it and dissolve myself down to
one small compendious vertebra so

carpenter resuming his work


well well well stubb knows him best of all and stubb always says
hes queer says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer hes
queer says stubb hes queerqueer queer and keeps dinning it into
mr starbuck all the timequeersirqueer queer very queer and
heres his leg yes now that i think of it heres his bedfellow has
a stick of whales jawbone for a wife and this is his leg hell stand
on this what was that now about one leg standing in three places and
all three places standing in one hellhow was that oh i dont wonder
he looked so scornful at me im a sort of strangethoughted sometimes
they say but thats only haphazardlike then a short little old body
like me should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall
heronbuilt captains the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick
and theres a great cry for lifeboats and heres the herons leg
long and slim sure enough now for most folks one pair of legs lasts
a lifetime and that must be because they use them mercifully as a
tenderhearted old lady uses her rolypoly old coachhorses but ahab
oh hes a hard driver look driven one leg to death and spavined the
other for life and now wears out bone legs by the cord halloa there
you smut bear a hand there with those screws and lets finish it
before the resurrection fellow comes acalling with his horn for
all legs true or false as brewerymen go round collecting old beer
barrels to fill em up again what a leg this is it looks like a real
live leg filed down to nothing but the core hell be standing on this
tomorrow hell be taking altitudes on it halloa i almost forgot the
little oval slate smoothed ivory where he figures up the latitude so
so chisel file and sandpaper now



chapter 109 ahab and starbuck in the cabin


according to usage they were pumping the ship next morning and lo no
inconsiderable oil came up with the water the casks below must have
sprung a bad leak much concern was shown and starbuck went down into
the cabin to report this unfavourable affair


in spermwhalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board it
is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold and drench
the casks with seawater which afterwards at varying intervals is
removed by the ships pumps hereby the casks are sought to be kept
damply tight while by the changed character of the withdrawn water the
mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo


now from the south and west the pequod was drawing nigh to formosa and
the bashee isles between which lies one of the tropical outlets from
the china waters into the pacific and so starbuck found ahab with
a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him
and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the
japanese islandsniphon matsmai and sikoke with his snowwhite new
ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table and with a long
pruninghook of a jackknife in his hand the wondrous old man with his
back to the gangway door was wrinkling his brow and tracing his old
courses again

whos there hearing the footstep at the door but not turning round
to it on deck begone

captain ahab mistakes it is i the oil in the hold is leaking sir we
must up burtons and break out

up burtons and break out now that we are nearing japan heaveto here
for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops

either do that sir or waste in one day more oil than we may make good
in a year what we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving
sir

so it is so it is if we get it

i was speaking of the oil in the hold sir

and i was not speaking or thinking of that at all begone let it leak
im all aleak myself aye leaks in leaks not only full of leaky casks
but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship and thats a far worse plight
than the pequods man yet i dont stop to plug my leak for who can
find it in the deeploaded hull or how hope to plug it even if
found in this lifes howling gale starbuck ill not have the burtons
hoisted

what will the owners say sir

let the owners stand on nantucket beach and outyell the typhoons what
cares ahab owners owners thou art always prating to me starbuck
about those miserly owners as if the owners were my conscience but
look ye the only real owner of anything is its commander and hark ye
my conscience is in this ships keelon deck

captain ahab said the reddening mate moving further into the cabin
with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed
not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation
of itself but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself
a better man than i might well pass over in thee what he would quickly
enough resent in a younger man aye and in a happier captain ahab

devils dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of meon
deck

nay sir not yet i do entreat and i do dare sirto be forbearing
shall we not understand each other better than hitherto captain ahab

ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack forming part of most
southseamens cabin furniture and pointing it towards starbuck
exclaimed there is one god that is lord over the earth and one
captain that is lord over the pequodon deck

for an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate and his fiery cheeks
you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of
the levelled tube but mastering his emotion he half calmly rose
and as he quitted the cabin paused for an instant and said thou hast
outraged not insulted me sir but for that i ask thee not to beware of
starbuck thou wouldst but laugh but let ahab beware of ahab beware of
thyself old man

he waxes brave but nevertheless obeys most careful bravery that
murmured ahab as starbuck disappeared whats that he saidahab
beware of ahabtheres something there then unconsciously using the
musket for a staff with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little
cabin but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed and
returning the gun to the rack he went to the deck

thou art but too good a fellow starbuck he said lowly to the mate
then raising his voice to the crew furl the tgallantsails and
closereef the topsails fore and aft back the mainyard up burton
and break out in the mainhold

it were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was that as respecting
starbuck ahab thus acted it may have been a flash of honesty in him
or mere prudential policy which under the circumstance imperiously
forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection however transient
in the important chief officer of his ship however it was his orders
were executed and the burtons were hoisted



chapter 110 queequeg in his coffin


upon searching it was found that the casks last struck into the hold
were perfectly sound and that the leak must be further off so it
being calm weather they broke out deeper and deeper disturbing the
slumbers of the huge groundtier butts and from that black midnight
sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above so deep did they
go and so ancient and corroded and weedy the aspect of the lowermost
puncheons that you almost looked next for some mouldy cornerstone cask
containing coins of captain noah with copies of the posted placards
vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood tierce after
tierce too of water and bread and beef and shooks of staves and
iron bundles of hoops were hoisted out till at last the piled decks
were hard to get about and the hollow hull echoed under foot as if
you were treading over empty catacombs and reeled and rolled in the sea
like an airfreighted demijohn topheavy was the ship as a dinnerless
student with all aristotle in his head well was it that the typhoons
did not visit them then

now at this time it was that my poor pagan companion and fast
bosomfriend queequeg was seized with a fever which brought him nigh
to his endless end

be it said that in this vocation of whaling sinecures are unknown
dignity and danger go hand in hand till you get to be captain the
higher you rise the harder you toil so with poor queequeg who as
harpooneer must not only face all the rage of the living whale butas
we have elsewhere seenmount his dead back in a rolling sea and
finally descend into the gloom of the hold and bitterly sweating
all day in that subterraneous confinement resolutely manhandle the
clumsiest casks and see to their stowage to be short among whalemen
the harpooneers are the holders so called

poor queequeg when the ship was about half disembowelled you should
have stooped over the hatchway and peered down upon him there where
stripped to his woollen drawers the tattooed savage was crawling about
amid that dampness and slime like a green spotted lizard at the bottom
of a well and a well or an icehouse it somehow proved to him poor
pagan where strange to say for all the heat of his sweatings he
caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever and at last after
some days suffering laid him in his hammock close to the very sill
of the door of death how he wasted and wasted away in those few
longlingering days till there seemed but little left of him but his
frame and tattooing but as all else in him thinned and his cheekbones
grew sharper his eyes nevertheless seemed growing fuller and fuller
they became of a strange softness of lustre and mildly but deeply
looked out at you there from his sickness a wondrous testimony to that
immortal health in him which could not die or be weakened and like
circles on the water which as they grow fainter expand so his eyes
seemed rounding and rounding like the rings of eternity an awe that
cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this
waning savage and saw as strange things in his face as any beheld who
were bystanders when zoroaster died for whatever is truly wondrous and
fearful in man never yet was put into words or books and the drawing
near of death which alike levels all alike impresses all with a last
revelation which only an author from the dead could adequately tell
so thatlet us say it againno dying chaldee or greek had higher and
holier thoughts than those whose mysterious shades you saw creeping
over the face of poor queequeg as he quietly lay in his swaying
hammock and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final
rest and the oceans invisible floodtide lifted him higher and higher
towards his destined heaven

not a man of the crew but gave him up and as for queequeg himself
what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he
asked he called one to him in the grey morning watch when the day was
just breaking and taking his hand said that while in nantucket he
had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood like the rich
warwood of his native isle and upon inquiry he had learned that all
whalemen who died in nantucket were laid in those same dark canoes
and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him for it was not
unlike the custom of his own race who after embalming a dead warrior
stretched him out in his canoe and so left him to be floated away to
the starry archipelagoes for not only do they believe that the stars
are isles but that far beyond all visible horizons their own mild
uncontinented seas interflow with the blue heavens and so form the
white breakers of the milky way he added that he shuddered at
the thought of being buried in his hammock according to the usual
seacustom tossed like something vile to the deathdevouring sharks
no he desired a canoe like those of nantucket all the more congenial
to him being a whaleman that like a whaleboat these coffincanoes
were without a keel though that involved but uncertain steering and
much leeway adown the dim ages

now when this strange circumstance was made known aft the carpenter
was at once commanded to do queequegs bidding whatever it might
include there was some heathenish coffincoloured old lumber aboard
which upon a long previous voyage had been cut from the aboriginal
groves of the lackaday islands and from these dark planks the coffin
was recommended to be made no sooner was the carpenter apprised of
the order than taking his rule he forthwith with all the indifferent
promptitude of his character proceeded into the forecastle and took
queequegs measure with great accuracy regularly chalking queequegs
person as he shifted the rule

ah poor fellow hell have to die now ejaculated the long island
sailor

going to his vicebench the carpenter for convenience sake and general
reference now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin
was to be and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches
at its extremities this done he marshalled the planks and his tools
and to work

when the last nail was driven and the lid duly planed and fitted
he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it inquiring
whether they were ready for it yet in that direction

overhearing the indignant but halfhumorous cries with which the
people on deck began to drive the coffin away queequeg to every ones
consternation commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to
him nor was there any denying him seeing that of all mortals some
dying men are the most tyrannical and certainly since they will
shortly trouble us so little for evermore the poor fellows ought to be
indulged

leaning over in his hammock queequeg long regarded the coffin with
an attentive eye he then called for his harpoon had the wooden stock
drawn from it and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along
with one of the paddles of his boat all by his own request also
biscuits were then ranged round the sides within a flask of fresh water
was placed at the head and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in
the hold at the foot and a piece of sailcloth being rolled up for a
pillow queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed that he
might make trial of its comforts if any it had he lay without moving
a few minutes then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little
god yojo then crossing his arms on his breast with yojo between he
called for the coffin lid hatch he called it to be placed over him
the head part turned over with a leather hinge and there lay queequeg
in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view rarmai
it will do it is easy he murmured at last and signed to be replaced
in his hammock

but ere this was done pip who had been slily hovering near by all this
while drew nigh to him where he lay and with soft sobbings took him
by the hand in the other holding his tambourine

poor rover will ye never have done with all this weary roving where
go ye now but if the currents carry ye to those sweet antilles where
the beaches are only beat with waterlilies will ye do one little
errand for me seek out one pip whos now been missing long i think
hes in those far antilles if ye find him then comfort him for he
must be very sad for look hes left his tambourine behindi found
it rigadig dig dig now queequeg die and ill beat ye your dying
march

i have heard murmured starbuck gazing down the scuttle that in
violent fevers men all ignorance have talked in ancient tongues
and that when the mystery is probed it turns out always that in their
wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken
in their hearing by some lofty scholars so to my fond faith poor pip
in this strange sweetness of his lunacy brings heavenly vouchers of all
our heavenly homes where learned he that but therehark he speaks
again but more wildly now

form two and two lets make a general of him ho wheres his harpoon
lay it across hererigadig dig dig huzza oh for a game cock
now to sit upon his head and crow queequeg dies gamemind ye that
queequeg dies gametake ye good heed of that queequeg dies game i
say game game game but base little pip he died a coward died all
ashiverout upon pip hark ye if ye find pip tell all the antilles
hes a runaway a coward a coward a coward tell them he jumped from
a whaleboat id never beat my tambourine over base pip and hail
him general if he were once more dying here no no shame upon all
cowardsshame upon them let em go drown like pip that jumped from a
whaleboat shame shame

during all this queequeg lay with closed eyes as if in a dream pip
was led away and the sick man was replaced in his hammock

but now that he had apparently made every preparation for death now
that his coffin was proved a good fit queequeg suddenly rallied soon
there seemed no need of the carpenters box and thereupon when some
expressed their delighted surprise he in substance said that the
cause of his sudden convalescence was thisat a critical moment he
had just recalled a little duty ashore which he was leaving undone
and therefore had changed his mind about dying he could not die yet
he averred they asked him then whether to live or die was a matter of
his own sovereign will and pleasure he answered certainly in a word
it was queequegs conceit that if a man made up his mind to live mere
sickness could not kill him nothing but a whale or a gale or some
violent ungovernable unintelligent destroyer of that sort

now there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized
that while a sick civilized man may be six months convalescing
generally speaking a sick savage is almost halfwell again in a day
so in good time my queequeg gained strength and at length after
sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days but eating with a
vigorous appetite he suddenly leaped to his feet threw out his arms
and legs gave himself a good stretching yawned a little bit and then
springing into the head of his hoisted boat and poising a harpoon
pronounced himself fit for a fight

with a wild whimsiness he now used his coffin for a seachest and
emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes set them in order there
many spare hours he spent in carving the lid with all manner of
grotesque figures and drawings and it seemed that hereby he was
striving in his rude way to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on
his body and this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and
seer of his island who by those hieroglyphic marks had written out on
his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth and a mystical
treatise on the art of attaining truth so that queequeg in his own
proper person was a riddle to unfold a wondrous work in one volume but
whose mysteries not even himself could read though his own live heart
beat against them and these mysteries were therefore destined in
the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were
inscribed and so be unsolved to the last and this thought it must
have been which suggested to ahab that wild exclamation of his when
one morning turning away from surveying poor queequegoh devilish
tantalization of the gods



chapter 111 the pacific


when gliding by the bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great south
sea were it not for other things i could have greeted my dear pacific
with uncounted thanks for now the long supplication of my youth was
answered that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues
of blue

there is one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea whose gently
awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath like those
fabled undulations of the ephesian sod over the buried evangelist st
john and meet it is that over these seapastures widerolling watery
prairies and potters fields of all four continents the waves should
rise and fall and ebb and flow unceasingly for here millions of mixed
shades and shadows drowned dreams somnambulisms reveries all that
we call lives and souls lie dreaming dreaming still tossing like
slumberers in their beds the everrolling waves but made so by their
restlessness

to any meditative magian rover this serene pacific once beheld must
ever after be the sea of his adoption it rolls the midmost waters of
the world the indian ocean and atlantic being but its arms the same
waves wash the moles of the newbuilt californian towns but yesterday
planted by the recentest race of men and lave the faded but still
gorgeous skirts of asiatic lands older than abraham while all between
float milkyways of coral isles and lowlying endless unknown
archipelagoes and impenetrable japans thus this mysterious divine
pacific zones the worlds whole bulk about makes all coasts one bay
to it seems the tidebeating heart of earth lifted by those eternal
swells you needs must own the seductive god bowing your head to pan

but few thoughts of pan stirred ahabs brain as standing like an
iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging with one
nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the bashee isles
in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking and with the other
consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea that sea in
which the hated white whale must even then be swimming launched at
length upon these almost final waters and gliding towards the japanese
cruisingground the old mans purpose intensified itself his firm lips
met like the lips of a vice the delta of his foreheads veins swelled
like overladen brooks in his very sleep his ringing cry ran through
the vaulted hull stern all the white whale spouts thick blood



chapter 112 the blacksmith


availing himself of the mild summercool weather that now reigned in
these latitudes and in preparation for the peculiarly active
pursuits shortly to be anticipated perth the begrimed blistered old
blacksmith had not removed his portable forge to the hold again after
concluding his contributory work for ahabs leg but still retained
it on deck fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast being now almost
incessantly invoked by the headsmen and harpooneers and bowsmen to do
some little job for them altering or repairing or new shaping their
various weapons and boat furniture often he would be surrounded by an
eager circle all waiting to be served holding boatspades pikeheads
harpoons and lances and jealously watching his every sooty movement
as he toiled nevertheless this old mans was a patient hammer wielded
by a patient arm no murmur no impatience no petulance did come from
him silent slow and solemn bowing over still further his chronically
broken back he toiled away as if toil were life itself and the
heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart and so it
wasmost miserable

a peculiar walk in this old man a certain slight but painful appearing
yawing in his gait had at an early period of the voyage excited the
curiosity of the mariners and to the importunity of their persisted
questionings he had finally given in and so it came to pass that every
one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate

belated and not innocently one bitter winters midnight on the road
running between two country towns the blacksmith halfstupidly felt
the deadly numbness stealing over him and sought refuge in a leaning
dilapidated barn the issue was the loss of the extremities of both
feet out of this revelation part by part at last came out the four
acts of the gladness and the one long and as yet uncatastrophied fifth
act of the grief of his lifes drama

he was an old man who at the age of nearly sixty had postponedly
encountered that thing in sorrows technicals called ruin he had been
an artisan of famed excellence and with plenty to do owned a house
and garden embraced a youthful daughterlike loving wife and three
blithe ruddy children every sunday went to a cheerfullooking church
planted in a grove but one night under cover of darkness and further
concealed in a most cunning disguisement a desperate burglar slid into
his happy home and robbed them all of everything and darker yet to
tell the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into
his familys heart it was the bottle conjuror upon the opening of that
fatal cork forth flew the fiend and shrivelled up his home now for
prudent most wise and economic reasons the blacksmiths shop was in
the basement of his dwelling but with a separate entrance to it so
that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no
unhappy nervousness but with vigorous pleasure to the stout ringing of
her youngarmed old husbands hammer whose reverberations muffled by
passing through the floors and walls came up to her not unsweetly
in her nursery and so to stout labors iron lullaby the blacksmiths
infants were rocked to slumber

oh woe on woe oh death why canst thou not sometimes be timely hadst
thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon
him then had the young widow had a delicious grief and her orphans a
truly venerable legendary sire to dream of in their after years and
all of them a carekilling competency but death plucked down some
virtuous elder brother on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the
responsibilities of some other family and left the worse than useless
old man standing till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to
harvest

why tell the whole the blows of the basement hammer every day grew more
and more between and each blow every day grew fainter than the last
the wife sat frozen at the window with tearless eyes glitteringly
gazing into the weeping faces of her children the bellows fell the
forge choked up with cinders the house was sold the mother dived
down into the long churchyard grass her children twice followed her
thither and the houseless familyless old man staggered off a vagabond
in crape his every woe unreverenced his grey head a scorn to flaxen
curls

death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this but death
is only a launching into the region of the strange untried it is but
the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense remote the
wild the watery the unshored therefore to the deathlonging eyes of
such men who still have left in them some interior compunctions against
suicide does the allcontributed and allreceptive ocean alluringly
spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable taking terrors and
wonderful newlife adventures and from the hearts of infinite
pacifics the thousand mermaids sing to themcome hither
brokenhearted here is another life without the guilt of intermediate
death here are wonders supernatural without dying for them come
hither bury thyself in a life which to your now equally abhorred and
abhorring landed world is more oblivious than death come hither put
up thy gravestone too within the churchyard and come hither till we
marry thee

hearkening to these voices east and west by early sunrise and by fall
of eve the blacksmiths soul responded aye i come and so perth went
awhaling



chapter 113 the forge


with matted beard and swathed in a bristling sharkskin apron about
midday perth was standing between his forge and anvil the latter
placed upon an ironwood log with one hand holding a pikehead in the
coals and with the other at his forges lungs when captain ahab came
along carrying in his hand a small rustylooking leathern bag while
yet a little distance from the forge moody ahab paused till at last
perth withdrawing his iron from the fire began hammering it upon the
anvilthe red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights
some of which flew close to ahab

are these thy mother careys chickens perth they are always flying
in thy wake birds of good omen too but not to alllook here they
burn but thouthou livst among them without a scorch

because i am scorched all over captain ahab answered perth resting
for a moment on his hammer i am past scorching not easily canst thou
scorch a scar

well well no more thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly sanely woeful
to me in no paradise myself i am impatient of all misery in others
that is not mad thou shouldst go mad blacksmith say why dost thou
not go mad how canst thou endure without being mad do the heavens yet
hate thee that thou canst not go madwhat wert thou making there

welding an old pikehead sir there were seams and dents in it

and canst thou make it all smooth again blacksmith after such hard
usage as it had

i think so sir

and i suppose thou canst smoothe almost any seams and dents never
mind how hard the metal blacksmith

aye sir i think i can all seams and dents but one

look ye here then cried ahab passionately advancing and leaning
with both hands on perths shoulders look ye hereherecan ye
smoothe out a seam like this blacksmith sweeping one hand across his
ribbed brow if thou couldst blacksmith glad enough would i lay
my head upon thy anvil and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes
answer canst thou smoothe this seam

oh that is the one sir said i not all seams and dents but one

aye blacksmith it is the one aye man it is unsmoothable for
though thou only seest it here in my flesh it has worked down into the
bone of my skullthat is all wrinkles but away with childs play no
more gaffs and pikes today look ye here jingling the leathern bag
as if it were full of gold coins i too want a harpoon made one that
a thousand yoke of fiends could not part perth something that will
stick in a whale like his own finbone theres the stuff flinging
the pouch upon the anvil look ye blacksmith these are the gathered
nailstubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses

horseshoe stubbs sir why captain ahab thou hast here then the
best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work

i know it old man these stubbs will weld together like glue from the
melted bones of murderers quick forge me the harpoon and forge me
first twelve rods for its shank then wind and twist and hammer these
twelve together like the yarns and strands of a towline quick ill
blow the fire

when at last the twelve rods were made ahab tried them one by one by
spiralling them with his own hand round a long heavy iron bolt a
flaw rejecting the last one work that over again perth

this done perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one when
ahab stayed his hand and said he would weld his own iron as then
with regular gasping hems he hammered on the anvil perth passing to
him the glowing rods one after the other and the hard pressed forge
shooting up its intense straight flame the parsee passed silently and
bowing over his head towards the fire seemed invoking some curse or
some blessing on the toil but as ahab looked up he slid aside

whats that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for muttered stubb
looking on from the forecastle that parsee smells fire like a fusee
and smells of it himself like a hot muskets powderpan

at last the shank in one complete rod received its final heat and as
perth to temper it plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near
by the scalding steam shot up into ahabs bent face

wouldst thou brand me perth wincing for a moment with the pain
have i been but forging my own brandingiron then

pray god not that yet i fear something captain ahab is not this
harpoon for the white whale

for the white fiend but now for the barbs thou must make them
thyself man here are my razorsthe best of steel here and make the
barbs sharp as the needlesleet of the icy sea

for a moment the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain
not use them

take them man i have no need for them for i now neither shave sup
nor pray tillbut hereto work

fashioned at last into an arrowy shape and welded by perth to the
shank the steel soon pointed the end of the iron and as the blacksmith
was about giving the barbs their final heat prior to tempering them he
cried to ahab to place the watercask near

no nono water for that i want it of the true deathtemper ahoy
there tashtego queequeg daggoo what say ye pagans will ye give me
as much blood as will cover this barb holding it high up a cluster of
dark nods replied yes three punctures were made in the heathen flesh
and the white whales barbs were then tempered

ego non baptizo te in nomine patris sed in nomine diaboli
deliriously howled ahab as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the
baptismal blood

now mustering the spare poles from below and selecting one of hickory
with the bark still investing it ahab fitted the end to the socket of
the iron a coil of new towline was then unwound and some fathoms of
it taken to the windlass and stretched to a great tension pressing
his foot upon it till the rope hummed like a harpstring then eagerly
bending over it and seeing no strandings ahab exclaimed good and
now for the seizings

at one extremity the rope was unstranded and the separate spread yarns
were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon the pole
was then driven hard up into the socket from the lower end the rope
was traced halfway along the poles length and firmly secured so with
intertwistings of twine this done pole iron and ropelike the three
fatesremained inseparable and ahab moodily stalked away with the
weapon the sound of his ivory leg and the sound of the hickory pole
both hollowly ringing along every plank but ere he entered his cabin
light unnatural halfbantering yet most piteous sound was heard oh
pip thy wretched laugh thy idle but unresting eye all thy strange
mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the
melancholy ship and mocked it



chapter 114 the gilder


penetrating further and further into the heart of the japanese cruising
ground the pequod was soon all astir in the fishery often in mild
pleasant weather for twelve fifteen eighteen and twenty hours on the
stretch they were engaged in the boats steadily pulling or sailing
or paddling after the whales or for an interlude of sixty or seventy
minutes calmly awaiting their uprising though with but small success
for their pains

at such times under an abated sun afloat all day upon smooth slow
heaving swells seated in his boat light as a birch canoe and so
sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves that like hearthstone
cats they purr against the gunwale these are the times of dreamy
quietude when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the
oceans skin one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it and
would not willingly remember that this velvet paw but conceals a
remorseless fang

these are the times when in his whaleboat the rover softly feels a
certain filial confident landlike feeling towards the sea that he
regards it as so much flowery earth and the distant ship revealing
only the tops of her masts seems struggling forward not through high
rolling waves but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie as when
the western emigrants horses only show their erected ears while their
hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure

the longdrawn virgin vales the mild blue hillsides as over these
there steals the hush the hum you almost swear that playwearied
children lie sleeping in these solitudes in some glad maytime when
the flowers of the woods are plucked and all this mixes with your most
mystic mood so that fact and fancy halfway meeting interpenetrate
and form one seamless whole

nor did such soothing scenes however temporary fail of at least as
temporary an effect on ahab but if these secret golden keys did seem
to open in him his own secret golden treasuries yet did his breath upon
them prove but tarnishing

oh grassy glades oh ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul in
yethough long parched by the dead drought of the earthy lifein ye
men yet may roll like young horses in new morning clover and for some
few fleeting moments feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them
would to god these blessed calms would last but the mingled mingling
threads of life are woven by warp and woof calms crossed by storms a
storm for every calm there is no steady unretracing progress in this
life we do not advance through fixed gradations and at the last one
pausethrough infancys unconscious spell boyhoods thoughtless
faith adolescence doubt the common doom then scepticism then
disbelief resting at last in manhoods pondering repose of if but once
gone through we trace the round again and are infants boys and men
and ifs eternally where lies the final harbor whence we unmoor no
more in what rapt ether sails the world of which the weariest will
never weary where is the foundlings father hidden our souls are like
those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them the secret of
our paternity lies in their grave and we must there to learn it

and that same day too gazing far down from his boats side into that
same golden sea starbuck lowly murmured

loveliness unfathomable as ever lover saw in his young brides
eyetell me not of thy teethtiered sharks and thy kidnapping
cannibal ways let faith oust fact let fancy oust memory i look deep
down and do believe

and stubb fishlike with sparkling scales leaped up in that same
golden light

i am stubb and stubb has his history but here stubb takes oaths that
he has always been jolly



chapter 115 the pequod meets the bachelor


and jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down
before the wind some few weeks after ahabs harpoon had been welded

it was a nantucket ship the bachelor which had just wedged in her
last cask of oil and bolted down her bursting hatches and now in glad
holiday apparel was joyously though somewhat vaingloriously sailing
round among the widelyseparated ships on the ground previous to
pointing her prow for home

the three men at her masthead wore long streamers of narrow red bunting
at their hats from the stern a whaleboat was suspended bottom down
and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the
last whale they had slain signals ensigns and jacks of all colours
were flying from her rigging on every side sideways lashed in each of
her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm above which in her
topmast crosstrees you saw slender breakers of the same precious
fluid and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp

as was afterwards learned the bachelor had met with the most surprising
success all the more wonderful for that while cruising in the same
seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a
single fish not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to
make room for the far more valuable sperm but additional supplemental
casks had been bartered for from the ships she had met and these were
stowed along the deck and in the captains and officers staterooms
even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindlingwood and the
cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oilbutt lashed down to the
floor for a centrepiece in the forecastle the sailors had actually
caulked and pitched their chests and filled them it was humorously
added that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler and
filled it that the steward had plugged his spare coffeepot and filled
it that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and
filled them that indeed everything was filled with sperm except the
captains pantaloons pockets and those he reserved to thrust his hands
into in selfcomplacent testimony of his entire satisfaction

as this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod the
barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle and drawing
still nearer a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge
trypots which covered with the parchmentlike poke or stomach skin of
the black fish gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched
hands of the crew on the quarterdeck the mates and harpooneers were
dancing with the olivehued girls who had eloped with them from the
polynesian isles while suspended in an ornamented boat firmly secured
aloft between the foremast and mainmast three long island negroes with
glittering fiddlebows of whale ivory were presiding over the hilarious
jig meanwhile others of the ships company were tumultuously busy at
the masonry of the tryworks from which the huge pots had been
removed you would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed
bastille such wild cries they raised as the now useless brick and
mortar were being hurled into the sea

lord and master over all this scene the captain stood erect on the
ships elevated quarterdeck so that the whole rejoicing drama was
full before him and seemed merely contrived for his own individual
diversion

and ahab he too was standing on his quarterdeck shaggy and black
with a stubborn gloom and as the two ships crossed each others
wakesone all jubilations for things passed the other all forebodings
as to things to cometheir two captains in themselves impersonated the
whole striking contrast of the scene

come aboard come aboard cried the gay bachelors commander lifting
a glass and a bottle in the air

hast seen the white whale gritted ahab in reply

no only heard of him but dont believe in him at all said the other
goodhumoredly come aboard

thou art too damned jolly sail on hast lost any men

not enough to speak oftwo islanders thats allbut come aboard
old hearty come along ill soon take that black from your brow come
along will ye merrys the play a full ship and homewardbound

how wondrous familiar is a fool muttered ahab then aloud thou art
a full ship and homeward bound thou sayst well then call me an empty
ship and outwardbound so go thy ways and i will mine forward there
set all sail and keep her to the wind

and thus while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze the other
stubbornly fought against it and so the two vessels parted the crew
of the pequod looking with grave lingering glances towards the receding
bachelor but the bachelors men never heeding their gaze for the lively
revelry they were in and as ahab leaning over the taffrail eyed the
homewardbound craft he took from his pocket a small vial of sand and
then looking from the ship to the vial seemed thereby bringing two
remote associations together for that vial was filled with nantucket
soundings



chapter 116 the dying whale


not seldom in this life when on the right side fortunes favourites
sail close by us we though all adroop before catch somewhat of the
rushing breeze and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out so seemed
it with the pequod for next day after encountering the gay bachelor
whales were seen and four were slain and one of them by ahab

it was far down the afternoon and when all the spearings of the crimson
fight were done and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky sun
and whale both stilly died together then such a sweetness and such
plaintiveness such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air that
it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of
the manilla isles the spanish landbreeze wantonly turned sailor had
gone to sea freighted with these vesper hymns

soothed again but only soothed to deeper gloom ahab who had sterned
off from the whale sat intently watching his final wanings from the now
tranquil boat for that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales
dyingthe turning sunwards of the head and so expiringthat strange
spectacle beheld of such a placid evening somehow to ahab conveyed a
wondrousness unknown before

he turns and turns him to ithow slowly but how steadfastly his
homagerendering and invoking brow with his last dying motions he too
worships fire most faithful broad baronial vassal of the sunoh
that these toofavouring eyes should see these toofavouring sights
look here far waterlocked beyond all hum of human weal or woe
in these most candid and impartial seas where to traditions no rocks
furnish tablets where for long chinese ages the billows have still
rolled on speechless and unspoken to as stars that shine upon the
nigers unknown source here too life dies sunwards full of faith but
see no sooner dead than death whirls round the corpse and it heads
some other way

oh thou dark hindoo half of nature who of drowned bones hast builded
thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas
thou art an infidel thou queen and too truly speakest to me in the
wideslaughtering typhoon and the hushed burial of its after calm nor
has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head and then gone round
again without a lesson to me

oh trebly hooped and welded hip of power oh high aspiring rainbowed
jetthat one strivest this one jettest all in vain in vain oh
whale dost thou seek intercedings with yon allquickening sun that
only calls forth life but gives it not again yet dost thou darker
half rock me with a prouder if a darker faith all thy unnamable
imminglings float beneath me here i am buoyed by breaths of once living
things exhaled as air but water now

then hail for ever hail o sea in whose eternal tossings the wild
fowl finds his only rest born of earth yet suckled by the sea though
hill and valley mothered me ye billows are my fosterbrothers



chapter 117 the whale watch


the four whales slain that evening had died wide apart one far to
windward one less distant to leeward one ahead one astern these
last three were brought alongside ere nightfall but the windward one
could not be reached till morning and the boat that had killed it lay
by its side all night and that boat was ahabs

the waifpole was thrust upright into the dead whales spouthole and
the lantern hanging from its top cast a troubled flickering glare
upon the black glossy back and far out upon the midnight waves which
gently chafed the whales broad flank like soft surf upon a beach

ahab and all his boats crew seemed asleep but the parsee who crouching
in the bow sat watching the sharks that spectrally played round the
whale and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails a sound
like the moaning in squadrons over asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of
gomorrah ran shuddering through the air

started from his slumbers ahab face to face saw the parsee and
hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a
flooded world i have dreamed it again said he

of the hearses have i not said old man that neither hearse nor
coffin can be thine

and who are hearsed that die on the sea

but i said old man that ere thou couldst die on this voyage two
hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea the first not made by
mortal hands and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in
america

aye aye a strange sight that parseea hearse and its plumes
floating over the ocean with the waves for the pallbearers ha such a
sight we shall not soon see

believe it or not thou canst not die till it be seen old man

and what was that saying about thyself

though it come to the last i shall still go before thee thy pilot

and when thou art so gone beforeif that ever befallthen ere i can
follow thou must still appear to me to pilot me stillwas it not
so well then did i believe all ye say oh my pilot i have here two
pledges that i shall yet slay moby dick and survive it

take another pledge old man said the parsee as his eyes lighted up
like fireflies in the gloomhemp only can kill thee

the gallows ye meani am immortal then on land and on sea cried
ahab with a laugh of derisionimmortal on land and on sea

both were silent again as one man the grey dawn came on and the
slumbering crew arose from the boats bottom and ere noon the dead
whale was brought to the ship



chapter 118 the quadrant


the season for the line at length drew near and every day when ahab
coming from his cabin cast his eyes aloft the vigilant helmsman would
ostentatiously handle his spokes and the eager mariners quickly run to
the braces and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed
on the nailed doubloon impatient for the order to point the ships
prow for the equator in good time the order came it was hard upon high
noon and ahab seated in the bows of his highhoisted boat was
about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his
latitude

now in that japanese sea the days in summer are as freshets of
effulgences that unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seems the blazing
focus of the glassy oceans immeasurable burningglass the sky looks
lacquered clouds there are none the horizon floats and this nakedness
of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of gods throne
well that ahabs quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses through
which to take sight of that solar fire so swinging his seated form
to the roll of the ship and with his astrologicallooking instrument
placed to his eye he remained in that posture for some moments to
catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian
meantime while his whole attention was absorbed the parsee was kneeling
beneath him on the ships deck and with face thrown up like ahabs
was eyeing the same sun with him only the lids of his eyes half hooded
their orbs and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness
at length the desired observation was taken and with his pencil upon
his ivory leg ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that
precise instant then falling into a moments revery he again looked up
towards the sun and murmured to himself thou seamark thou high and
mighty pilot thou tellest me truly where i ambut canst thou cast the
least hint where i shall be or canst thou tell where some other thing
besides me is this moment living where is moby dick this instant thou
must be eyeing him these eyes of mine look into the very eye that is
even now beholding him aye and into the eye that is even now equally
beholding the objects on the unknown thither side of thee thou sun

then gazing at his quadrant and handling one after the other its
numerous cabalistical contrivances he pondered again and muttered
foolish toy babies plaything of haughty admirals and commodores and
captains the world brags of thee of thy cunning and might but what
after all canst thou do but tell the poor pitiful point where thou
thyself happenest to be on this wide planet and the hand that holds
thee no not one jot more thou canst not tell where one drop of water
or one grain of sand will be tomorrow noon and yet with thy impotence
thou insultest the sun science curse thee thou vain toy and cursed
be all the things that cast mans eyes aloft to that heaven whose live
vividness but scorches him as these old eyes are even now scorched
with thy light o sun level by nature to this earths horizon are the
glances of mans eyes not shot from the crown of his head as if god
had meant him to gaze on his firmament curse thee thou quadrant
dashing it to the deck no longer will i guide my earthly way by thee
the level ships compass and the level deadreckoning by log and by
line these shall conduct me and show me my place on the sea aye
lighting from the boat to the deck thus i trample on thee thou paltry
thing that feebly pointest on high thus i split and destroy thee

as the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live
and dead feet a sneering triumph that seemed meant for ahab and a
fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himselfthese passed over
the mute motionless parsees face unobserved he rose and glided away
while awestruck by the aspect of their commander the seamen clustered
together on the forecastle till ahab troubledly pacing the deck
shouted outto the braces up helmsquare in

in an instant the yards swung round and as the ship halfwheeled upon
her heel her three firmseated graceful masts erectly poised upon
her long ribbed hull seemed as the three horatii pirouetting on one
sufficient steed

standing between the knightheads starbuck watched the pequods
tumultuous way and ahabs also as he went lurching along the deck

i have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow full of
its tormented flaming life and i have seen it wane at last down down
to dumbest dust old man of oceans of all this fiery life of thine
what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes

aye cried stubb but seacoal ashesmind ye that mr
starbuckseacoal not your common charcoal well well i heard ahab
mutter here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine
swears that i must play them and no others and damn me ahab but
thou actest right live in the game and die in it



chapter 119 the candles


warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs the tiger of bengal
crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure skies the most effulgent
but basket the deadliest thunders gorgeous cuba knows tornadoes
that never swept tame northern lands so too it is that in these
resplendent japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all
storms the typhoon it will sometimes burst from out that cloudless
sky like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town

towards evening of that day the pequod was torn of her canvas and
barepoled was left to fight a typhoon which had struck her directly
ahead when darkness came on sky and sea roared and split with the
thunder and blazed with the lightning that showed the disabled masts
fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the
tempest had left for its after sport

holding by a shroud starbuck was standing on the quarterdeck at every
flash of the lightning glancing aloft to see what additional disaster
might have befallen the intricate hamper there while stubb and flask
were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the
boats but all their pains seemed naught though lifted to the very
top of the cranes the windward quarter boat ahabs did not escape
a great rolling sea dashing high up against the reeling ships high
teetering side stove in the boats bottom at the stern and left it
again all dripping through like a sieve

bad work bad work mr starbuck said stubb regarding the wreck
but the sea will have its way stubb for one cant fight it you see
mr starbuck a wave has such a great long start before it leaps all
round the world it runs and then comes the spring but as for me all
the start i have to meet it is just across the deck here but never
mind its all in fun so the old song sayssings

  oh jolly is the gale
  and a joker is the whale
  a flourishin his tail
  such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hokypoky lad is the ocean oh

  the scud all a flyin
  thats his flip only foamin
  when he stirs in the spicin
  such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hokypoky lad is the ocean oh

  thunder splits the ships
  but he only smacks his lips
  a tastin of this flip
  such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hokypoky lad is the ocean oh


avast stubb cried starbuck let the typhoon sing and strike his
harp here in our rigging but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy
peace

but i am not a brave man never said i was a brave man i am a coward
and i sing to keep up my spirits and i tell you what it is mr
starbuck theres no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my
throat and when thats done ten to one i sing ye the doxology for a
windup

madman look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own

what how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else never
mind how foolish

here cried starbuck seizing stubb by the shoulder and pointing his
hand towards the weather bow markest thou not that the gale comes from
the eastward the very course ahab is to run for moby dick the very
course he swung to this day noon now mark his boat there where is
that stove in the sternsheets man where he is wont to standhis
standpoint is stove man now jump overboard and sing away if thou
must

i dont half understand ye whats in the wind

yes yes round the cape of good hope is the shortest way to
nantucket soliloquized starbuck suddenly heedless of stubbs
question the gale that now hammers at us to stave us we can turn it
into a fair wind that will drive us towards home yonder to windward
all is blackness of doom but to leeward homewardi see it lightens up
there but not with the lightning

at that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness following
the flashes a voice was heard at his side and almost at the same
instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead

whos there

old thunder said ahab groping his way along the bulwarks to his
pivothole but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed
lances of fire

now as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off
the perilous fluid into the soil so the kindred rod which at sea some
ships carry to each mast is intended to conduct it into the water but
as this conductor must descend to considerable depth that its end may
avoid all contact with the hull and as moreover if kept constantly
towing there it would be liable to many mishaps besides interfering
not a little with some of the rigging and more or less impeding the
vessels way in the water because of all this the lower parts of a
ships lightningrods are not always overboard but are generally made
in long slender links so as to be the more readily hauled up into the
chains outside or thrown down into the sea as occasion may require

the rods the rods cried starbuck to the crew suddenly admonished to
vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux
to light ahab to his post are they overboard drop them over fore and
aft quick

avast cried ahab lets have fair play here though we be the weaker
side yet ill contribute to raise rods on the himmalehs and andes that
all the world may be secured but out on privileges let them be sir

look aloft cried starbuck the corpusants the corpusants

all the yardarms were tipped with a pallid fire and touched at each
tripointed lightningrodend with three tapering white flames each of
the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air like
three gigantic wax tapers before an altar

blast the boat let it go cried stubb at this instant as a swashing
sea heaved up under his own little craft so that its gunwale violently
jammed his hand as he was passing a lashing blast itbut
slipping backward on the deck his uplifted eyes caught the flames and
immediately shifting his tone he criedthe corpusants have mercy on us
all

to sailors oaths are household words they will swear in the trance of
the calm and in the teeth of the tempest they will imprecate curses
from the topsailyardarms when most they teeter over to a seething
sea but in all my voyagings seldom have i heard a common oath when
gods burning finger has been laid on the ship when his mene mene
tekel upharsin has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage

while this pallidness was burning aloft few words were heard from the
enchanted crew who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle
all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence like a far away
constellation of stars relieved against the ghostly light the gigantic
jet negro daggoo loomed up to thrice his real stature and seemed
the black cloud from which the thunder had come the parted mouth of
tashtego revealed his sharkwhite teeth which strangely gleamed as
if they too had been tipped by corpusants while lit up by the
preternatural light queequegs tattooing burned like satanic blue
flames on his body

the tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft and once more
the pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall a moment
or two passed when starbuck going forward pushed against some one it
was stubb what thinkest thou now man i heard thy cry it was not the
same in the song

no no it wasnt i said the corpusants have mercy on us all and i
hope they will still but do they only have mercy on long faceshave
they no bowels for a laugh and look ye mr starbuckbut its too dark
to look hear me then i take that masthead flame we saw for a sign
of good luck for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be
chock a block with spermoil dye see and so all that sperm will
work up into the masts like sap in a tree yes our three masts will
yet be as three spermaceti candlesthats the good promise we saw

at that moment starbuck caught sight of stubbs face slowly beginning
to glimmer into sight glancing upwards he cried see see and once
more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled
supernaturalness in their pallor

the corpusants have mercy on us all cried stubb again

at the base of the mainmast full beneath the doubloon and the flame
the parsee was kneeling in ahabs front but with his head bowed away
from him while near by from the arched and overhanging rigging where
they had just been engaged securing a spar a number of the seamen
arrested by the glare now cohered together and hung pendulous like a
knot of numbed wasps from a drooping orchard twig in various enchanted
attitudes like the standing or stepping or running skeletons in
herculaneum others remained rooted to the deck but all their eyes
upcast

aye aye men cried ahab look up at it mark it well the white
flame but lights the way to the white whale hand me those mainmast
links there i would fain feel this pulse and let mine beat against it
blood against fire so

then turningthe last link held fast in his left hand he put his foot
upon the parsee and with fixed upward eye and highflung right arm he
stood erect before the lofty tripointed trinity of flames

oh thou clear spirit of clear fire whom on these seas i as persian
once did worship till in the sacramental act so burned by thee that to
this hour i bear the scar i now know thee thou clear spirit and i now
know that thy right worship is defiance to neither love nor reverence
wilt thou be kind and een for hate thou canst but kill and all
are killed no fearless fool now fronts thee i own thy speechless
placeless power but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will
dispute its unconditional unintegral mastery in me in the midst of the
personified impersonal a personality stands here though but a point at
best whencesoeer i came wheresoeer i go yet while i earthly live
the queenly personality lives in me and feels her royal rights but war
is pain and hate is woe come in thy lowest form of love and i will
kneel and kiss thee but at thy highest come as mere supernal power
and though thou launchest navies of fullfreighted worlds theres that
in here that still remains indifferent oh thou clear spirit of thy
fire thou madest me and like a true child of fire i breathe it back to
thee

sudden repeated flashes of lightning the nine flames leap lengthwise
to thrice their previous height ahab with the rest closes his eyes
his right hand pressed hard upon them

i own thy speechless placeless power said i not so nor was it wrung
from me nor do i now drop these links thou canst blind but i can then
grope thou canst consume but i can then be ashes take the homage of
these poor eyes and shutterhands i would not take it the lightning
flashes through my skull mine eyeballs ache and ache my whole beaten
brain seems as beheaded and rolling on some stunning ground oh oh
yet blindfold yet will i talk to thee light though thou be thou
leapest out of darkness but i am darkness leaping out of light leaping
out of thee the javelins cease open eyes see or not there burn the
flames oh thou magnanimous now i do glory in my genealogy but thou
art but my fiery father my sweet mother i know not oh cruel what
hast thou done with her there lies my puzzle but thine is greater
thou knowest not how came ye hence callest thyself unbegotten
certainly knowest not thy beginning hence callest thyself unbegun i
know that of me which thou knowest not of thyself oh thou omnipotent
there is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee thou clear spirit to whom
all thy eternity is but time all thy creativeness mechanical through
thee thy flaming self my scorched eyes do dimly see it oh thou
foundling fire thou hermit immemorial thou too hast thy incommunicable
riddle thy unparticipated grief here again with haughty agony i read
my sire leap leap up and lick the sky i leap with thee i burn with
thee would fain be welded with thee defyingly i worship thee

the boat the boat cried starbuck look at thy boat old man

ahabs harpoon the one forged at perths fire remained firmly lashed
in its conspicuous crotch so that it projected beyond his whaleboats
bow but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather
sheath to drop off and from the keen steel barb there now came a
levelled flame of pale forked fire as the silent harpoon burned there
like a serpents tongue starbuck grasped ahab by the armgod god
is against thee old man forbear tis an ill voyage ill begun ill
continued let me square the yards while we may old man and make a
fair wind of it homewards to go on a better voyage than this

overhearing starbuck the panicstricken crew instantly ran to the
bracesthough not a sail was left aloft for the moment all the aghast
mates thoughts seemed theirs they raised a half mutinous cry but
dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck and snatching the
burning harpoon ahab waved it like a torch among them swearing to
transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a ropes end
petrified by his aspect and still more shrinking from the fiery dart
that he held the men fell back in dismay and ahab again spoke

all your oaths to hunt the white whale are as binding as mine and
heart soul and body lungs and life old ahab is bound and that ye
may know to what tune this heart beats look ye here thus i blow out
the last fear and with one blast of his breath he extinguished the
flame

as in the hurricane that sweeps the plain men fly the neighborhood of
some lone gigantic elm whose very height and strength but render it so
much the more unsafe because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts
so at those last words of ahabs many of the mariners did run from him
in a terror of dismay



chapter 120 the deck towards the end of the first night watch

ahab standing by the helm starbuck approaching him


we must send down the maintopsail yard sir the band is working loose
and the lee lift is halfstranded shall i strike it sir

strike nothing lash it if i had skysail poles id sway them up
now

sirin gods namesir

well

the anchors are working sir shall i get them inboard

strike nothing and stir nothing but lash everything the wind rises
but it has not got up to my tablelands yet quick and see to itby
masts and keels he takes me for the hunchbacked skipper of some
coasting smack send down my maintopsail yard ho gluepots loftiest
trucks were made for wildest winds and this braintruck of mine now
sails amid the cloudscud shall i strike that oh none but cowards
send down their braintrucks in tempest time what a hooroosh aloft
there i would een take it for sublime did i not know that the colic
is a noisy malady oh take medicine take medicine



chapter 121 midnightthe forecastle bulwarks


stubb and flask mounted on them and passing additional lashings over
the anchors there hanging


no stubb you may pound that knot there as much as you please but you
will never pound into me what you were just now saying and how long
ago is it since you said the very contrary didnt you once say that
whatever ship ahab sails in that ship should pay something extra on its
insurance policy just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft
and boxes of lucifers forward stop now didnt you say so

well suppose i did what then ive part changed my flesh since that
time why not my mind besides supposing we are loaded with powder
barrels aft and lucifers forward how the devil could the lucifers get
afire in this drenching spray here why my little man you have
pretty red hair but you couldnt get afire now shake yourself youre
aquarius or the waterbearer flask might fill pitchers at your coat
collar dont you see then that for these extra risks the marine
insurance companies have extra guarantees here are hydrants flask but
hark again and ill answer ye the other thing first take your leg off
from the crown of the anchor here though so i can pass the rope
now listen whats the mighty difference between holding a masts
lightningrod in the storm and standing close by a mast that hasnt
got any lightningrod at all in a storm dont you see you timberhead
that no harm can come to the holder of the rod unless the mast is first
struck what are you talking about then not one ship in a hundred
carries rods and ahabaye man and all of uswere in no more
danger then in my poor opinion than all the crews in ten thousand
ships now sailing the seas why you kingpost you i suppose you would
have every man in the world go about with a small lightningrod running
up the corner of his hat like a militia officers skewered feather
and trailing behind like his sash why dont ye be sensible flask its
easy to be sensible why dont ye then any man with half an eye can be
sensible

i dont know that stubb you sometimes find it rather hard

yes when a fellows soaked through its hard to be sensible thats
a fact and i am about drenched with this spray never mind catch the
turn there and pass it seems to me we are lashing down these anchors
now as if they were never going to be used again tying these two
anchors here flask seems like tying a mans hands behind him and what
big generous hands they are to be sure these are your iron fists
hey what a hold they have too i wonder flask whether the world is
anchored anywhere if she is she swings with an uncommon long cable
though there hammer that knot down and weve done so next to
touching land lighting on deck is the most satisfactory i say just
wring out my jacket skirts will ye thank ye they laugh at longtogs
so flask but seems to me a long tailed coat ought always to be worn
in all storms afloat the tails tapering down that way serve to carry
off the water dye see same with cocked hats the cocks form gableend
eavetroughs flask no more monkeyjackets and tarpaulins for me i
must mount a swallowtail and drive down a beaver so halloa whew
there goes my tarpaulin overboard lord lord that the winds that come
from heaven should be so unmannerly this is a nasty night lad

um um um stop that thunder plenty too much thunder up here whats
the use of thunder um um um we dont want thunder we want rum give
us a glass of rum um um um



chapter 123 the musket


during the most violent shocks of the typhoon the man at the pequods
jawbone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by
its spasmodic motions even though preventer tackles had been attached
to itfor they were slackbecause some play to the tiller was
indispensable

in a severe gale like this while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock
to the blast it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the
compasses at intervals go round and round it was thus with the
pequods at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice
the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards it is
a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted
emotion

some hours after midnight the typhoon abated so much that through the
strenuous exertions of starbuck and stubbone engaged forward and the
other aftthe shivered remnants of the jib and fore and maintopsails
were cut adrift from the spars and went eddying away to leeward like
the feathers of an albatross which sometimes are cast to the winds when
that stormtossed bird is on the wing

the three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed and a
stormtrysail was set further aft so that the ship soon went through
the water with some precision again and the coursefor the present
eastsoutheastwhich he was to steer if practicable was once more
given to the helmsman for during the violence of the gale he had only
steered according to its vicissitudes but as he was now bringing the
ship as near her course as possible watching the compass meanwhile lo
a good sign the wind seemed coming round astern aye the foul breeze
became fair

instantly the yards were squared to the lively song of ho the
fair wind ohyeho cheerly men the crew singing for joy that so
promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents
preceding it

in compliance with the standing order of his commanderto report
immediately and at any one of the twentyfour hours any decided change
in the affairs of the deckstarbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to
the breezehowever reluctantly and gloomilythan he mechanically went
below to apprise captain ahab of the circumstance

ere knocking at his stateroom he involuntarily paused before it
a moment the cabin lamptaking long swings this way and thatwas
burning fitfully and casting fitful shadows upon the old mans bolted
doora thin one with fixed blinds inserted in place of upper panels
the isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming
silence to reign there though it was hooped round by all the roar of
the elements the loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed as
they stood upright against the forward bulkhead starbuck was an honest
upright man but out of starbucks heart at that instant when he saw
the muskets there strangely evolved an evil thought but so blent with
its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew
it for itself

he would have shot me once he murmured yes theres the very musket
that he pointed at methat one with the studded stock let me touch
itlift it strange that i who have handled so many deadly lances
strange that i should shake so now loaded i must see aye aye and
powder in the panthats not good best spill itwait ill cure
myself of this ill hold the musket boldly while i thinki come
to report a fair wind to him but how fair fair for death and
doomthats fair for moby dick its a fair wind thats only fair for
that accursed fishthe very tube he pointed at methe very one
this onei hold it here he would have killed me with the very thing i
handle nowaye and he would fain kill all his crew does he not say
he will not strike his spars to any gale has he not dashed his heavenly
quadrant and in these same perilous seas gropes he not his way by mere
dead reckoning of the errorabounding log and in this very typhoon did
he not swear that he would have no lightningrods but shall this crazed
old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ships company down to doom
with himyes it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and
more if this ship come to any deadly harm and come to deadly harm my
soul swears this ship will if ahab have his way if then he were this
instantput aside that crime would not be his ha is he muttering in
his sleep yes just therein there hes sleeping sleeping aye
but still alive and soon awake again i cant withstand thee then old
man not reasoning not remonstrance not entreaty wilt thou hearken to
all this thou scornest flat obedience to thy own flat commands this is
all thou breathest aye and sayst the men have vowd thy vow sayst
all of us are ahabs great god forbidbut is there no other way no
lawful waymake him a prisoner to be taken home what hope to wrest
this old mans living power from his own living hands only a fool
would try it say he were pinioned even knotted all over with ropes
and hawsers chained down to ringbolts on this cabin floor he would
be more hideous than a caged tiger then i could not endure the
sight could not possibly fly his howlings all comfort sleep itself
inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage what
then remains the land is hundreds of leagues away and locked japan
the nearest i stand alone here upon an open sea with two oceans and
a whole continent between me and lawaye aye tis sois heaven
a murderer when its lightning strikes a wouldbe murderer in his bed
tindering sheets and skin togetherand would i be a murderer then
ifand slowly stealthily and half sideways looking he placed the
loaded muskets end against the door

on this level ahabs hammock swings within his head this way a
touch and starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child againoh
mary maryboy boy boybut if i wake thee not to death old man
who can tell to what unsounded deeps starbucks body this day week
may sink with all the crew great god where art thou shall i shall
ithe wind has gone down and shifted sir the fore and main topsails
are reefed and set she heads her course

stern all oh moby dick i clutch thy heart at last

such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old mans
tormented sleep as if starbucks voice had caused the long dumb dream
to speak

the yet levelled musket shook like a drunkards arm against the panel
starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel but turning from the door he
placed the deathtube in its rack and left the place

hes too sound asleep mr stubb go thou down and wake him and tell
him i must see to the deck here thou knowst what to say



chapter 124 the needle


next morning the notyetsubsided sea rolled in long slow billows of
mighty bulk and striving in the pequods gurgling track pushed her on
like giants palms outspread the strong unstaggering breeze abounded
so that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails the whole world
boomed before the wind muffled in the full morning light the invisible
sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place where his
bayonet rays moved on in stacks emblazonings as of crowned babylonian
kings and queens reigned over everything the sea was as a crucible of
molten gold that bubblingly leaps with light and heat

long maintaining an enchanted silence ahab stood apart and every time
the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to eye
the bright suns rays produced ahead and when she profoundly settled by
the stern he turned behind and saw the suns rearward place and how
the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake

ha ha my ship thou mightest well be taken now for the seachariot of
the sun ho ho all ye nations before my prow i bring the sun to ye
yoke on the further billows hallo a tandem i drive the sea

but suddenly reined back by some counter thought he hurried towards the
helm huskily demanding how the ship was heading

eastsoueast sir said the frightened steersman

thou liest smiting him with his clenched fist heading east at this
hour in the morning and the sun astern

upon this every soul was confounded for the phenomenon just then
observed by ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else but its very
blinding palpableness must have been the cause

thrusting his head half way into the binnacle ahab caught one glimpse
of the compasses his uplifted arm slowly fell for a moment he almost
seemed to stagger standing behind him starbuck looked and lo the two
compasses pointed east and the pequod was as infallibly going west

but ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew
the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed i have it it has happened
before mr starbuck last nights thunder turned our compassesthats
all thou hast before now heard of such a thing i take it

aye but never before has it happened to me sir said the pale mate
gloomily

here it must needs be said that accidents like this have in more than
one case occurred to ships in violent storms the magnetic energy as
developed in the mariners needle is as all know essentially one with
the electricity beheld in heaven hence it is not to be much marvelled
at that such things should be instances where the lightning has
actually struck the vessel so as to smite down some of the spars and
rigging the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal
all its loadstone virtue being annihilated so that the before magnetic
steel was of no more use than an old wifes knitting needle but in
either case the needle never again of itself recovers the original
virtue thus marred or lost and if the binnacle compasses be affected
the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship even were
the lowermost one inserted into the kelson

deliberately standing before the binnacle and eyeing the transpointed
compasses the old man with the sharp of his extended hand now took
the precise bearing of the sun and satisfied that the needles were
exactly inverted shouted out his orders for the ships course to be
changed accordingly the yards were hard up and once more the pequod
thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind for the supposed fair
one had only been juggling her

meanwhile whatever were his own secret thoughts starbuck said nothing
but quietly he issued all requisite orders while stubb and flaskwho
in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelingslikewise
unmurmuringly acquiesced as for the men though some of them lowly
rumbled their fear of ahab was greater than their fear of fate but as
ever before the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed
or if impressed it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their
congenial hearts from inflexible ahabs

for a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries but
chancing to slip with his ivory heel he saw the crushed copper
sighttubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck

thou poor proud heavengazer and suns pilot yesterday i wrecked
thee and today the compasses would fain have wrecked me so so but
ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet mr starbucka lance without
a pole a topmaul and the smallest of the sailmakers needles
quick

accessory perhaps to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about
to do were certain prudential motives whose object might have been to
revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill in a
matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses besides the old
man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles though clumsily
practicable was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors
without some shudderings and evil portents

men said he steadily turning upon the crew as the mate handed
him the things he had demanded my men the thunder turned old ahabs
needles but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of his own that
will point as true as any

abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors as this
was said and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might
follow but starbuck looked away

with a blow from the topmaul ahab knocked off the steel head of the
lance and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining bade
him hold it upright without its touching the deck then with the maul
after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod he placed the
blunted needle endwise on the top of it and less strongly hammered
that several times the mate still holding the rod as before then
going through some small strange motions with itwhether indispensable
to the magnetizing of the steel or merely intended to augment the awe
of the crew is uncertainhe called for linen thread and moving to the
binnacle slipped out the two reversed needles there and horizontally
suspended the sailneedle by its middle over one of the compasscards
at first the steel went round and round quivering and vibrating at
either end but at last it settled to its place when ahab who had
been intently watching for this result stepped frankly back from the
binnacle and pointing his stretched arm towards it exclaimedlook
ye for yourselves if ahab be not lord of the level loadstone the sun
is east and that compass swears it

one after another they peered in for nothing but their own eyes could
persuade such ignorance as theirs and one after another they slunk
away

in his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph you then saw ahab in all his
fatal pride



chapter 125 the log and line


while now the fated pequod had been so long afloat this voyage the log
and line had but very seldom been in use owing to a confident reliance
upon other means of determining the vessels place some merchantmen
and many whalemen especially when cruising wholly neglect to heave the
log though at the same time and frequently more for forms sake than
anything else regularly putting down upon the customary slate the
course steered by the ship as well as the presumed average rate of
progression every hour it had been thus with the pequod the wooden
reel and angular log attached hung long untouched just beneath the
railing of the after bulwarks rains and spray had damped it sun and
wind had warped it all the elements had combined to rot a thing that
hung so idly but heedless of all this his mood seized ahab as he
happened to glance upon the reel not many hours after the magnet scene
and he remembered how his quadrant was no more and recalled his frantic
oath about the level log and line the ship was sailing plungingly
astern the billows rolled in riots

forward there heave the log

two seamen came the goldenhued tahitian and the grizzly manxman take
the reel one of ye ill heave

they went towards the extreme stern on the ships lee side where the
deck with the oblique energy of the wind was now almost dipping into
the creamy sidelongrushing sea

the manxman took the reel and holding it high up by the projecting
handleends of the spindle round which the spool of line revolved so
stood with the angular log hanging downwards till ahab advanced to him

ahab stood before him and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty
turns to form a preliminary handcoil to toss overboard when the old
manxman who was intently eyeing both him and the line made bold to
speak

sir i mistrust it this line looks far gone long heat and wet have
spoiled it

twill hold old gentleman long heat and wet have they spoiled thee
thou seemst to hold or truer perhaps life holds thee not thou it

i hold the spool sir but just as my captain says with these
grey hairs of mine tis not worth while disputing specially with a
superior wholl neer confess

whats that there nows a patched professor in queen natures
granitefounded college but methinks hes too subservient where wert
thou born

in the little rocky isle of man sir

excellent thoust hit the world by that

i know not sir but i was born there

in the isle of man hey well the other way its good heres a man
from man a man born in once independent man and now unmanned of man
which is sucked inby what up with the reel the dead blind wall
butts all inquiring heads at last up with it so

the log was heaved the loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long
dragging line astern and then instantly the reel began to whirl in
turn jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows the towing
resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely

hold hard

snap the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon the tugging
log was gone

i crush the quadrant the thunder turns the needles and now the mad
sea parts the logline but ahab can mend all haul in here tahitian
reel up manxman and look ye let the carpenter make another log and
mend thou the line see to it

there he goes now to him nothings happened but to me the skewer
seems loosening out of the middle of the world haul in haul in
tahitian these lines run whole and whirling out come in broken and
dragging slow ha pip come to help eh pip

pip whom call ye pip pip jumped from the whaleboat pips missing
lets see now if ye havent fished him up here fisherman it drags
hard i guess hes holding on jerk him tahiti jerk him off we haul
in no cowards here ho theres his arm just breaking water a hatchet
a hatchet cut it offwe haul in no cowards here captain ahab sir
sir heres pip trying to get on board again

peace thou crazy loon cried the manxman seizing him by the arm
away from the quarterdeck

the greater idiot ever scolds the lesser muttered ahab advancing
hands off from that holiness where sayest thou pip was boy

astern there sir astern lo lo

and who art thou boy i see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of
thy eyes oh god that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve
through who art thou boy

bellboy sir shipscrier ding dong ding pip pip pip
one hundred pounds of clay reward for pip five feet highlooks
cowardlyquickest known by that ding dong ding whos seen pip the
coward

there can be no hearts above the snowline oh ye frozen heavens look
down here ye did beget this luckless child and have abandoned him
ye creative libertines here boy ahabs cabin shall be pips home
henceforth while ahab lives thou touchest my inmost centre boy thou
art tied to me by cords woven of my heartstrings come lets down

whats this heres velvet sharkskin intently gazing at ahabs hand
and feeling it ah now had poor pip but felt so kind a thing as this
perhaps he had neer been lost this seems to me sir as a manrope
something that weak souls may hold by oh sir let old perth now come
and rivet these two hands together the black one with the white for i
will not let this go

oh boy nor will i thee unless i should thereby drag thee to worse
horrors than are here come then to my cabin lo ye believers in
gods all goodness and in man all ill lo you see the omniscient gods
oblivious of suffering man and man though idiotic and knowing not
what he does yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude come
i feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand than though i grasped an
emperors

there go two daft ones now muttered the old manxman one daft with
strength the other daft with weakness but heres the end of the rotten
lineall dripping too mend it eh i think we had best have a new
line altogether ill see mr stubb about it



chapter 126 the lifebuoy


steering now southeastward by ahabs levelled steel and her progress
solely determined by ahabs level log and line the pequod held on
her path towards the equator making so long a passage through such
unfrequented waters descrying no ships and ere long sideways impelled
by unvarying trade winds over waves monotonously mild all these seemed
the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene

at last when the ship drew near to the outskirts as it were of the
equatorial fishingground and in the deep darkness that goes before the
dawn was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets the watchthen headed
by flaskwas startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthlylike
halfarticulated wailings of the ghosts of all herods murdered
innocentsthat one and all they started from their reveries and for
the space of some moments stood or sat or leaned all transfixedly
listening like the carved roman slave while that wild cry remained
within hearing the christian or civilized part of the crew said it was
mermaids and shuddered but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled
yet the grey manxmanthe oldest mariner of alldeclared that the wild
thrilling sounds that were heard were the voices of newly drowned men
in the sea

below in his hammock ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn when
he came to the deck it was then recounted to him by flask not
unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings he hollowly laughed and thus
explained the wonder

those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers
of seals and some young seals that had lost their dams or some dams
that had lost their cubs must have risen nigh the ship and kept company
with her crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail but this
only the more affected some of them because most mariners cherish a
very superstitious feeling about seals arising not only from their
peculiar tones when in distress but also from the human look of their
round heads and semiintelligent faces seen peeringly uprising from
the water alongside in the sea under certain circumstances seals have
more than once been mistaken for men

but the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible
confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning at
sunrise this man went from his hammock to his masthead at the fore
and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep for
sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state whether it was thus
with the man there is now no telling but be that as it may he
had not been long at his perch when a cry was hearda cry and a
rushingand looking up they saw a falling phantom in the air and
looking down a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the
sea

the lifebuoya long slender caskwas dropped from the stern where it
always hung obedient to a cunning spring but no hand rose to seize it
and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken so that it
slowly filled and that parched wood also filled at its every pore and
the studded ironbound cask followed the sailor to the bottom as if to
yield him his pillow though in sooth but a hard one

and thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look out
for the white whale on the white whales own peculiar ground that man
was swallowed up in the deep but few perhaps thought of that at the
time indeed in some sort they were not grieved at this event at
least as a portent for they regarded it not as a foreshadowing of evil
in the future but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged they
declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had
heard the night before but again the old manxman said nay

the lost lifebuoy was now to be replaced starbuck was directed to see
to it but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found and as
in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of
the voyage all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly
connected with its final end whatever that might prove to be
therefore they were going to leave the ships stern unprovided with a
buoy when by certain strange signs and inuendoes queequeg hinted a hint
concerning his coffin

a lifebuoy of a coffin cried starbuck starting

rather queer that i should say said stubb

it will make a good enough one said flask the carpenter here can
arrange it easily

bring it up theres nothing else for it said starbuck after a
melancholy pause rig it carpenter do not look at me sothe coffin
i mean dost thou hear me rig it

and shall i nail down the lid sir moving his hand as with a hammer

aye

and shall i caulk the seams sir moving his hand as with a
caulkingiron

aye

and shall i then pay over the same with pitch sir moving his hand as
with a pitchpot

away what possesses thee to this make a lifebuoy of the coffin and
no moremr stubb mr flask come forward with me

he goes off in a huff the whole he can endure at the parts he baulks
now i dont like this i make a leg for captain ahab and he wears it
like a gentleman but i make a bandbox for queequeg and he wont put
his head into it are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin
and now im ordered to make a lifebuoy of it its like turning an old
coat going to bring the flesh on the other side now i dont like this
cobbling sort of businessi dont like it at all its undignified
its not my place let tinkers brats do tinkerings we are their
betters i like to take in hand none but clean virgin fairandsquare
mathematical jobs something that regularly begins at the beginning and
is at the middle when midway and comes to an end at the conclusion not
a cobblers job thats at an end in the middle and at the beginning at
the end its the old womans tricks to be giving cobbling jobs lord
what an affection all old women have for tinkers i know an old woman of
sixtyfive who ran away with a baldheaded young tinker once and thats
the reason i never would work for lonely widow old women ashore when
i kept my jobshop in the vineyard they might have taken it into their
lonely old heads to run off with me but heighho there are no caps at
sea but snowcaps let me see nail down the lid caulk the seams pay
over the same with pitch batten them down tight and hang it with the
snapspring over the ships stern were ever such things done before
with a coffin some superstitious old carpenters now would be tied
up in the rigging ere they would do the job but im made of knotty
aroostook hemlock i dont budge cruppered with a coffin sailing
about with a graveyard tray but never mind we workers in woods make
bridalbedsteads and cardtables as well as coffins and hearses we
work by the month or by the job or by the profit not for us to ask
the why and wherefore of our work unless it be too confounded cobbling
and then we stash it if we can hem ill do the job now tenderly
ill have melets seehow many in the ships company all told but
ive forgotten any way ill have me thirty separate turksheaded
lifelines each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin then
if the hull go down therell be thirty lively fellows all fighting for
one coffin a sight not seen very often beneath the sun come hammer
caulkingiron pitchpot and marlingspike lets to it



chapter 127 the deck


the coffin laid upon two linetubs between the vicebench and the open
hatchway the carpenter caulking its seams the string of twisted oakum
slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of
his frockahab comes slowly from the cabingangway and hears pip
following him


back lad i will be with ye again presently he goes not this hand
complies with my humor more genially than that boymiddle aisle of a
church whats here

lifebuoy sir mr starbucks orders oh look sir beware the
hatchway

thank ye man thy coffin lies handy to the vault

sir the hatchway oh so it does sir so it does

art not thou the legmaker look did not this stump come from thy
shop

i believe it did sir does the ferrule stand sir

well enough but art thou not also the undertaker

aye sir i patched up this thing here as a coffin for queequeg but
theyve set me now to turning it into something else

then tell me art thou not an arrant allgrasping intermeddling
monopolising heathenish old scamp to be one day making legs and the
next day coffins to clap them in and yet again lifebuoys out of those
same coffins thou art as unprincipled as the gods and as much of a
jackofalltrades

but i do not mean anything sir i do as i do

the gods again hark ye dost thou not ever sing working about a
coffin the titans they say hummed snatches when chipping out the
craters for volcanoes and the gravedigger in the play sings spade in
hand dost thou never

sing sir do i sing oh im indifferent enough sir for that but
the reason why the gravedigger made music must have been because there
was none in his spade sir but the caulking mallet is full of it hark
to it

aye and thats because the lid theres a soundingboard and what in
all things makes the soundingboard is thistheres naught beneath and
yet a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same carpenter
hast thou ever helped carry a bier and heard the coffin knock against
the churchyard gate going in

faith sir ive

faith whats that

why faith sir its only a sort of exclamationlikethats all
sir

um um go on

i was about to say sir that

art thou a silkworm dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself
look at thy bosom despatch and get these traps out of sight

he goes aft that was sudden now but squalls come sudden in hot
latitudes ive heard that the isle of albemarle one of the gallipagos
is cut by the equator right in the middle seems to me some sort of
equator cuts yon old man too right in his middle hes always under
the linefiery hot i tell ye hes looking this waycome oakum
quick here we go again this wooden mallet is the cork and im the
professor of musical glassestap tap

ahab to himself

theres a sight theres a sound the greyheaded woodpecker tapping
the hollow tree blind and dumb might well be envied now see that
thing rests on two linetubs full of towlines a most malicious wag
that fellow rattat so mans seconds tick oh how immaterial are all
materials what things real are there but imponderable thoughts here
nows the very dreaded symbol of grim death by a mere hap made
the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life
a lifebuoy of a coffin does it go further can it be that in some
spiritual sense the coffin is after all but an immortalitypreserver
ill think of that but no so far gone am i in the dark side of earth
that its other side the theoretic bright one seems but uncertain
twilight to me will ye never have done carpenter with that accursed
sound i go below let me not see that thing here when i return
again now then pip well talk this over i do suck most wondrous
philosophies from thee some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds
must empty into thee



chapter 128 the pequod meets the rachel


next day a large ship the rachel was descried bearing directly down
upon the pequod all her spars thickly clustering with men at the
time the pequod was making good speed through the water but as the
broadwinged windward stranger shot nigh to her the boastful sails all
fell together as blank bladders that are burst and all life fled from
the smitten hull

bad news she brings bad news muttered the old manxman but ere her
commander who with trumpet to mouth stood up in his boat ere he
could hopefully hail ahabs voice was heard

hast seen the white whale

aye yesterday have ye seen a whaleboat adrift

throttling his joy ahab negatively answered this unexpected question
and would then have fain boarded the stranger when the stranger captain
himself having stopped his vessels way was seen descending her
side a few keen pulls and his boathook soon clinched the pequods
mainchains and he sprang to the deck immediately he was recognised by
ahab for a nantucketer he knew but no formal salutation was exchanged

where was henot killednot killed cried ahab closely advancing
how was it

it seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous while
three of the strangers boats were engaged with a shoal of whales which
had led them some four or five miles from the ship and while they were
yet in swift chase to windward the white hump and head of moby dick had
suddenly loomed up out of the water not very far to leeward whereupon
the fourth rigged boata reserved onehad been instantly lowered in
chase after a keen sail before the wind this fourth boatthe swiftest
keeled of allseemed to have succeeded in fasteningat least as
well as the man at the masthead could tell anything about it in the
distance he saw the diminished dotted boat and then a swift gleam
of bubbling white water and after that nothing more whence it was
concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with
his pursuers as often happens there was some apprehension but no
positive alarm as yet the recall signals were placed in the rigging
darkness came on and forced to pick up her three far to windward
boatsere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite
directionthe ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to
its fate till near midnight but for the time to increase her distance
from it but the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard she crowded
all sailstunsail on stunsailafter the missing boat kindling a fire
in her trypots for a beacon and every other man aloft on the lookout
but though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the
presumed place of the absent ones when last seen though she then
paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her and not finding
anything had again dashed on again paused and lowered her boats and
though she had thus continued doing till daylight yet not the least
glimpse of the missing keel had been seen

the story told the stranger captain immediately went on to reveal his
object in boarding the pequod he desired that ship to unite with his
own in the search by sailing over the sea some four or five miles
apart on parallel lines and so sweeping a double horizon as it were

i will wager something now whispered stubb to flask that some one
in that missing boat wore off that captains best coat mayhap his
watchhes so cursed anxious to get it back who ever heard of two
pious whaleships cruising after one missing whaleboat in the height of
the whaling season see flask only see how pale he lookspale in the
very buttons of his eyeslookit wasnt the coatit must have been
the

my boy my own boy is among them for gods sakei beg i
conjurehere exclaimed the stranger captain to ahab who thus far
had but icily received his petition for eightandforty hours let me
charter your shipi will gladly pay for it and roundly pay for itif
there be no other wayfor eightandforty hours onlyonly thatyou
must oh you must and you shall do this thing

his son cried stubb oh its his son hes lost i take back the
coat and watchwhat says ahab we must save that boy

hes drowned with the rest on em last night said the old manx
sailor standing behind them i heard all of ye heard their spirits

now as it shortly turned out what made this incident of the rachels
the more melancholy was the circumstance that not only was one of the
captains sons among the number of the missing boats crew but among
the number of the other boats crews at the same time but on the other
hand separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase
there had been still another son as that for a time the wretched
father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity which
was only solved for him by his chief mates instinctively adopting the
ordinary procedure of a whaleship in such emergencies that is when
placed between jeopardized but divided boats always to pick up the
majority first but the captain for some unknown constitutional reason
had refrained from mentioning all this and not till forced to it by
ahabs iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy a little lad
but twelve years old whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving
hardihood of a nantucketers paternal love had thus early sought to
initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially
the destiny of all his race nor does it unfrequently occur that
nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them
for a protracted three or four years voyage in some other ship than
their own so that their first knowledge of a whalemans career shall
be unenervated by any chance display of a fathers natural but untimely
partiality or undue apprehensiveness and concern

meantime now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of ahab
and ahab still stood like an anvil receiving every shock but without
the least quivering of his own

i will not go said the stranger till you say aye to me do to me
as you would have me do to you in the like case for you too have a boy
captain ahabthough but a child and nestling safely at home nowa
child of your old age tooyes yes you relent i see itrun run
men now and stand by to square in the yards

avast cried ahabtouch not a ropeyarn then in a voice that
prolongingly moulded every wordcaptain gardiner i will not do it
even now i lose time goodbye goodbye god bless ye man and may i
forgive myself but i must go mr starbuck look at the binnacle watch
and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers
then brace forward again and let the ship sail as before

hurriedly turning with averted face he descended into his cabin
leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter
rejection of his so earnest suit but starting from his enchantment
gardiner silently hurried to the side more fell than stepped into his
boat and returned to his ship

soon the two ships diverged their wakes and long as the strange vessel
was in view she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot
however small on the sea this way and that her yards were swung round
starboard and larboard she continued to tack now she beat against a
head sea and again it pushed her before it while all the while her
masts and yards were thickly clustered with men as three tall cherry
trees when the boys are cherrying among the boughs

but by her still halting course and winding woeful way you plainly saw
that this ship that so wept with spray still remained without comfort
she was rachel weeping for her children because they were not



chapter 129 the cabin


ahab moving to go on deck pip catches him by the hand to follow

lad lad i tell thee thou must not follow ahab now the hour is coming
when ahab would not scare thee from him yet would not have thee by him
there is that in thee poor lad which i feel too curing to my malady

chapter 130 the hat


and now that at the proper time and place after so long and wide a
preliminary cruise ahaball other whaling waters sweptseemed to
have chased his foe into an oceanfold to slay him the more securely
there now that he found himself hard by the very latitude and
longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted now that a
vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually
encountered moby dickand now that all his successive meetings with
various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference
with which the white whale tore his hunters whether sinning or sinned
against now it was that there lurked a something in the old mans eyes
which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see as the unsetting
polar star which through the livelong arctic six months night
sustains its piercing steady central gaze so ahabs purpose now
fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew it
domineered above them so that all their bodings doubts misgivings
fears were fain to hide beneath their souls and not sprout forth a
single spear or leaf

in this foreshadowing interval too all humor forced or natural
vanished stubb no more strove to raise a smile starbuck no more strove
to check one alike joy and sorrow hope and fear seemed ground to
finest dust and powdered for the time in the clamped mortar of
ahabs iron soul like machines they dumbly moved about the deck ever
conscious that the old mans despot eye was on them

but did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours when
he thought no glance but one was on him then you would have seen that
even as ahabs eyes so awed the crews the inscrutable parsees glance
awed his or somehow at least in some wild way at times affected it
such an added gliding strangeness began to invest the thin fedallah
now such ceaseless shudderings shook him that the men looked dubious
at him half uncertain as it seemed whether indeed he were a mortal
substance or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen
beings body and that shadow was always hovering there for not by
night even had fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber or go
below he would stand still for hours but never sat or leaned his wan
but wondrous eyes did plainly saywe two watchmen never rest

nor at any time by night or day could the mariners now step upon the
deck unless ahab was before them either standing in his pivothole or
exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limitsthe mainmast
and the mizen or else they saw him standing in the cabinscuttlehis
living foot advanced upon the deck as if to step his hat slouched
heavily over his eyes so that however motionless he stood however the
days and nights were added on that he had not swung in his hammock
yet hidden beneath that slouching hat they could never tell unerringly
whether for all this his eyes were really closed at times or whether
he was still intently scanning them no matter though he stood so in
the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch and the unheeded nightdamp
gathered in beads of dew upon that stonecarved coat and hat the
clothes that the night had wet the next days sunshine dried upon him
and so day after day and night after night he went no more beneath
the planks whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for

he ate in the same open air that is his two only mealsbreakfast and
dinner supper he never touched nor reaped his beard which darkly grew
all gnarled as unearthed roots of trees blown over which still grow
idly on at naked base though perished in the upper verdure but though
his whole life was now become one watch on deck and though the parsees
mystic watch was without intermission as his own yet these two never
seemed to speakone man to the otherunless at long intervals some
passing unmomentous matter made it necessary though such a potent spell
seemed secretly to join the twain openly and to the awestruck crew
they seemed polelike asunder if by day they chanced to speak one word
by night dumb men were both so far as concerned the slightest verbal
interchange at times for longest hours without a single hail they
stood far parted in the starlight ahab in his scuttle the parsee by
the mainmast but still fixedly gazing upon each other as if in the
parsee ahab saw his forethrown shadow in ahab the parsee his abandoned
substance

and yet somehow did ahabin his own proper self as daily hourly
and every instant commandingly revealed to his subordinatesahab
seemed an independent lord the parsee but his slave still again both
seemed yoked together and an unseen tyrant driving them the lean shade
siding the solid rib for be this parsee what he may all rib and keel
was solid ahab

at the first faintest glimmering of the dawn his iron voice was heard
from aftman the mastheadsand all through the day till after
sunset and after twilight the same voice every hour at the striking of
the helmsmans bell was heardwhat dye seesharp sharp

but when three or four days had slided by after meeting the
childrenseeking rachel and no spout had yet been seen the monomaniac
old man seemed distrustful of his crews fidelity at least of nearly
all except the pagan harpooneers he seemed to doubt even whether
stubb and flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought but if
these suspicions were really his he sagaciously refrained from verbally
expressing them however his actions might seem to hint them

i will have the first sight of the whale myselfhe said aye
ahab must have the doubloon and with his own hands he rigged a nest
of basketed bowlines and sending a hand aloft with a single sheaved
block to secure to the mainmast head he received the two ends of the
downwardreeved rope and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for
the other end in order to fasten it at the rail this done with that
end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin he looked round upon
his crew sweeping from one to the other pausing his glance long upon
daggoo queequeg tashtego but shunning fedallah and then settling his
firm relying eye upon the chief mate saidtake the rope siri give
it into thy hands starbuck then arranging his person in the basket
he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch starbuck being
the one who secured the rope at last and afterwards stood near it and
thus with one hand clinging round the royal mast ahab gazed abroad
upon the sea for miles and milesahead astern this side and
thatwithin the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height

when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in
the rigging which chances to afford no foothold the sailor at sea is
hoisted up to that spot and sustained there by the rope under these
circumstances its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge
to some one man who has the special watch of it because in such a
wilderness of running rigging whose various different relations aloft
cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the
deck and when the deckends of these ropes are being every few minutes
cast down from the fastenings it would be but a natural fatality if
unprovided with a constant watchman the hoisted sailor should by some
carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the
sea so ahabs proceedings in this matter were not unusual the only
strange thing about them seemed to be that starbuck almost the one
only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the
slightest degree approaching to decisionone of those too whose
faithfulness on the lookout he had seemed to doubt somewhatit was
strange that this was the very man he should select for his watchman
freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted persons
hands

now the first time ahab was perched aloft ere he had been there ten
minutes one of those redbilled savage seahawks which so often fly
incommodiously close round the manned mastheads of whalemen in these
latitudes one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head
in a maze of untrackably swift circlings then it darted a thousand feet
straight up into the air then spiralized downwards and went eddying
again round his head

but with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon ahab seemed
not to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else have marked
it much it being no uncommon circumstance only now almost the least
heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every
sight

your hat your hat sir suddenly cried the sicilian seaman who
being posted at the mizenmasthead stood directly behind ahab though
somewhat lower than his level and with a deep gulf of air dividing
them

but already the sable wing was before the old mans eyes the long
hooked bill at his head with a scream the black hawk darted away with
his prize

an eagle flew thrice round tarquins head removing his cap to replace
it and thereupon tanaquil his wife declared that tarquin would
be king of rome but only by the replacing of the cap was that omen
accounted good ahabs hat was never restored the wild hawk flew on and
on with it far in advance of the prow and at last disappeared while
from the point of that disappearance a minute black spot was dimly
discerned falling from that vast height into the sea



chapter 131 the pequod meets the delight


the intense pequod sailed on the rolling waves and days went by the
lifebuoycoffin still lightly swung and another ship most miserably
misnamed the delight was descried as she drew nigh all eyes were
fixed upon her broad beams called shears which in some whalingships
cross the quarterdeck at the height of eight or nine feet serving to
carry the spare unrigged or disabled boats

upon the strangers shears were beheld the shattered white ribs and
some few splintered planks of what had once been a whaleboat but you
now saw through this wreck as plainly as you see through the peeled
halfunhinged and bleaching skeleton of a horse

hast seen the white whale

look replied the hollowcheeked captain from his taffrail and with
his trumpet he pointed to the wreck

hast killed him

the harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that answered the
other sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck whose gathered
sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together

not forged and snatching perths levelled iron from the crotch ahab
held it out exclaiminglook ye nantucketer here in this hand i hold
his death tempered in blood and tempered by lightning are these barbs
and i swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin
where the white whale most feels his accursed life

then god keep thee old manseest thou thatpointing to the
hammocki bury but one of five stout men who were alive only
yesterday but were dead ere night only that one i bury the rest were
buried before they died you sail upon their tomb then turning to his
creware ye ready there place the plank then on the rail and
lift the body so thenoh godadvancing towards the hammock with
uplifted handsmay the resurrection and the life

brace forward up helm cried ahab like lightning to his men

but the suddenly started pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound
of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea not so
quick indeed but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled
her hull with their ghostly baptism

as ahab now glided from the dejected delight the strange lifebuoy
hanging at the pequods stern came into conspicuous relief

ha yonder look yonder men cried a foreboding voice in her wake
in vain oh ye strangers ye fly our sad burial ye but turn us your
taffrail to show us your coffin



chapter 132 the symphony


it was a clear steelblue day the firmaments of air and sea were
hardly separable in that allpervading azure only the pensive air was
transparently pure and soft with a womans look and the robust and
manlike sea heaved with long strong lingering swells as samsons
chest in his sleep

hither and thither on high glided the snowwhite wings of small
unspeckled birds these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air
but to and fro in the deeps far down in the bottomless blue rushed
mighty leviathans swordfish and sharks and these were the strong
troubled murderous thinkings of the masculine sea

but though thus contrasting within the contrast was only in shades and
shadows without those two seemed one it was only the sex as it were
that distinguished them

aloft like a royal czar and king the sun seemed giving this gentle
air to this bold and rolling sea even as bride to groom and at the
girdling line of the horizon a soft and tremulous motionmost seen
here at the equatordenoted the fond throbbing trust the loving
alarms with which the poor bride gave her bosom away

tied up and twisted gnarled and knotted with wrinkles haggardly firm
and unyielding his eyes glowing like coals that still glow in the
ashes of ruin untottering ahab stood forth in the clearness of the
morn lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girls
forehead of heaven

oh immortal infancy and innocency of the azure invisible winged
creatures that frolic all round us sweet childhood of air and sky how
oblivious were ye of old ahabs closecoiled woe but so have i seen
little miriam and martha laughingeyed elves heedlessly gambol around
their old sire sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on
the marge of that burntout crater of his brain

slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle ahab leaned over the side and
watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze the more
and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity but the lovely
aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel for a moment
the cankerous thing in his soul that glad happy air that winsome
sky did at last stroke and caress him the stepmother world so long
cruelforbiddingnow threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck
and did seem to joyously sob over him as if over one that however
wilful and erring she could yet find it in her heart to save and to
bless from beneath his slouched hat ahab dropped a tear into the sea
nor did all the pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop

starbuck saw the old man saw him how he heavily leaned over the side
and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that
stole out of the centre of the serenity around careful not to touch
him or be noticed by him he yet drew near to him and stood there

ahab turned

starbuck

sir

oh starbuck it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky on such
a dayvery much such a sweetness as thisi struck my first whalea
boyharpooneer of eighteen fortyfortyforty years agoago forty
years of continual whaling forty years of privation and peril and
stormtime forty years on the pitiless sea for forty years has ahab
forsaken the peaceful land for forty years to make war on the horrors
of the deep aye and yes starbuck out of those forty years i have not
spent three ashore when i think of this life i have led the desolation
of solitude it has been the masoned walledtown of a captains
exclusiveness which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the
green country withoutoh weariness heaviness guineacoast slavery of
solitary commandwhen i think of all this only halfsuspected not so
keenly known to me beforeand how for forty years i have fed upon dry
salted farefit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soilwhen the
poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand and broken the
worlds fresh bread to my mouldy crustsaway whole oceans away from
that young girlwife i wedded past fifty and sailed for cape horn
the next day leaving but one dent in my marriage pillowwife
wiferather a widow with her husband alive aye i widowed that poor
girl when i married her starbuck and then the madness the frenzy
the boiling blood and the smoking brow with which for a thousand
lowerings old ahab has furiously foamingly chased his preymore a
demon than a manaye aye what a forty years foolfoolold fool
has old ahab been why this strife of the chase why weary and palsy
the arm at the oar and the iron and the lance how the richer or
better is ahab now behold oh starbuck is it not hard that with this
weary load i bear one poor leg should have been snatched from under
me here brush this old hair aside it blinds me that i seem to weep
locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes but do i look
very old so very very old starbuck i feel deadly faint bowed and
humped as though i were adam staggering beneath the piled
centuries since paradise god god godcrack my heartstave my
brainmockery mockery bitter biting mockery of grey hairs have
i lived enough joy to wear ye and seem and feel thus intolerably old
close stand close to me starbuck let me look into a human eye it is
better than to gaze into sea or sky better than to gaze upon god by
the green land by the bright hearthstone this is the magic glass
man i see my wife and my child in thine eye no no stay on board on
boardlower not when i do when branded ahab gives chase to moby dick
that hazard shall not be thine no no not with the far away home i see
in that eye

oh my captain my captain noble soul grand old heart after all why
should any one give chase to that hated fish away with me let us
fly these deadly waters let us home wife and child too are
starbuckswife and child of his brotherly sisterly playfellow
youth even as thine sir are the wife and child of thy loving
longing paternal old age away let us awaythis instant let me alter
the course how cheerily how hilariously o my captain would we bowl
on our way to see old nantucket again i think sir they have some such
mild blue days even as this in nantucket

they have they have i have seen themsome summer days in the
morning about this timeyes it is his noon nap nowthe boy
vivaciously wakes sits up in bed and his mother tells him of me of
cannibal old me how i am abroad upon the deep but will yet come back
to dance him again

tis my mary my mary herself she promised that my boy every morning
should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his fathers
sail yes yes no more it is done we head for nantucket come my
captain study out the course and let us away see see the boys face
from the window the boys hand on the hill

but ahabs glance was averted like a blighted fruit tree he shook and
cast his last cindered apple to the soil

what is it what nameless inscrutable unearthly thing is it what
cozening hidden lord and master and cruel remorseless emperor
commands me that against all natural lovings and longings i so keep
pushing and crowding and jamming myself on all the time recklessly
making me ready to do what in my own proper natural heart i durst not
so much as dare is ahab ahab is it i god or who that lifts this
arm but if the great sun move not of himself but is as an errandboy
in heaven nor one single star can revolve but by some invisible power
how then can this one small heart beat this one small brain think
thoughts unless god does that beating does that thinking does that
living and not i by heaven man we are turned round and round in
this world like yonder windlass and fate is the handspike and all
the time lo that smiling sky and this unsounded sea look see yon
albicore who put it into him to chase and fang that flyingfish where
do murderers go man whos to doom when the judge himself is dragged
to the bar but it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky and
the air smells now as if it blew from a faraway meadow they have been
making hay somewhere under the slopes of the andes starbuck and the
mowers are sleeping among the newmown hay sleeping aye toil we how
we may we all sleep at last on the field sleep aye and rust amid
greenness as last years scythes flung down and left in the halfcut
swathsstarbuck

but blanched to a corpses hue with despair the mate had stolen away

ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side but started at
two reflected fixed eyes in the water there fedallah was motionlessly
leaning over the same rail



chapter 133 the chasefirst day


that night in the midwatch when the old manas his wont at
intervalsstepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned and went
to his pivothole he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely snuffing
up the sea air as a sagacious ships dog will in drawing nigh to
some barbarous isle he declared that a whale must be near soon that
peculiar odor sometimes to a great distance given forth by the
living sperm whale was palpable to all the watch nor was any mariner
surprised when after inspecting the compass and then the dogvane and
then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible
ahab rapidly ordered the ships course to be slightly altered and the
sail to be shortened

the acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated
at daybreak by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and
lengthwise ahead smooth as oil and resembling in the pleated watery
wrinkles bordering it the polished metalliclike marks of some swift
tiderip at the mouth of a deep rapid stream

man the mastheads call all hands

thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle
deck daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they
seemed to exhale from the scuttle so instantaneously did they appear
with their clothes in their hands

what dye see cried ahab flattening his face to the sky

nothing nothing sir was the sound hailing down in reply

tgallant sailsstunsails alow and aloft and on both sides

all sail being set he now cast loose the lifeline reserved for
swaying him to the main royalmast head and in a few moments they were
hoisting him thither when while but two thirds of the way aloft
and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the
maintopsail and topgallantsail he raised a gulllike cry in the
air there she blowsthere she blows a hump like a snowhill it is
moby dick

fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three
lookouts the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous
whale they had so long been pursuing ahab had now gained his final
perch some feet above the other lookouts tashtego standing just
beneath him on the cap of the topgallantmast so that the indians
head was almost on a level with ahabs heel from this height the whale
was now seen some mile or so ahead at every roll of the sea revealing
his high sparkling hump and regularly jetting his silent spout into the
air to the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had
so long ago beheld in the moonlit atlantic and indian oceans

and did none of ye see it before cried ahab hailing the perched men
all around him

i saw him almost that same instant sir that captain ahab did and i
cried out said tashtego

not the same instant not the sameno the doubloon is mine fate
reserved the doubloon for me i only none of ye could have raised the
white whale first there she blowsthere she blowsthere she blows
there againthere again he cried in longdrawn lingering methodic
tones attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whales visible jets
hes going to sound in stunsails down topgallantsails stand by
three boats mr starbuck remember stay on board and keep the ship
helm there luff luff a point so steady man steady there go
flukes no no only black water all ready the boats there stand by
stand by lower me mr starbuck lower lowerquick quicker and he
slid through the air to the deck

he is heading straight to leeward sir cried stubb right away from
us cannot have seen the ship yet

be dumb man stand by the braces hard down the helmbrace up
shiver hershiver herso well that boats boats

soon all the boats but starbucks were dropped all the boatsails
setall the paddles plying with rippling swiftness shooting to
leeward and ahab heading the onset a pale deathglimmer lit up
fedallahs sunken eyes a hideous motion gnawed his mouth

like noiseless nautilus shells their light prows sped through the sea
but only slowly they neared the foe as they neared him the ocean grew
still more smooth seemed drawing a carpet over its waves seemed a
noonmeadow so serenely it spread at length the breathless hunter came
so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey that his entire dazzling hump
was distinctly visible sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing
and continually set in a revolving ring of finest fleecy greenish
foam he saw the vast involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head
beyond before it far out on the soft turkishrugged waters went
the glistening white shadow from his broad milky forehead a musical
rippling playfully accompanying the shade and behind the blue waters
interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake
and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side but
these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly
feathering the sea alternate with their fitful flight and like to
some flagstaff rising from the painted hull of an argosy the tall but
shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whales back
and at intervals one of the cloud of softtoed fowls hovering and
to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish silently perched and
rocked on this pole the long tail feathers streaming like pennons

a gentle joyousnessa mighty mildness of repose in swiftness invested
the gliding whale not the white bull jupiter swimming away with
ravished europa clinging to his graceful horns his lovely leering
eyes sideways intent upon the maid with smooth bewitching fleetness
rippling straight for the nuptial bower in crete not jove not that
great majesty supreme did surpass the glorified white whale as he so
divinely swam

on each soft sidecoincident with the parted swell that but once
leaving him then flowed so wide awayon each bright side the whale
shed off enticings no wonder there had been some among the hunters who
namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity had ventured
to assail it but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of
tornadoes yet calm enticing calm oh whale thou glidest on to all
who for the first time eye thee no matter how many in that same way
thou mayst have bejuggled and destroyed before

and thus through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea among
waves whose handclappings were suspended by exceeding rapture moby
dick moved on still withholding from sight the full terrors of his
submerged trunk entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw
but soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water for an instant
his whole marbleized body formed a high arch like virginias natural
bridge and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air the
grand god revealed himself sounded and went out of sight hoveringly
halting and dipping on the wing the white seafowls longingly lingered
over the agitated pool that he left

with oars apeak and paddles down the sheets of their sails adrift the
three boats now stilly floated awaiting moby dicks reappearance

an hour said ahab standing rooted in his boats stern and he gazed
beyond the whales place towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing
vacancies to leeward it was only an instant for again his eyes seemed
whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle the breeze now
freshened the sea began to swell

the birdsthe birds cried tashtego

in long indian file as when herons take wing the white birds were
now all flying towards ahabs boat and when within a few yards began
fluttering over the water there wheeling round and round with joyous
expectant cries their vision was keener than mans ahab could discover
no sign in the sea but suddenly as he peered down and down into its
depths he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white
weasel with wonderful celerity uprising and magnifying as it rose
till it turned and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked
rows of white glistening teeth floating up from the undiscoverable
bottom it was moby dicks open mouth and scrolled jaw his vast
shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea the
glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an opendoored marble
tomb and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar ahab whirled
the craft aside from this tremendous apparition then calling upon
fedallah to change places with him went forward to the bows and
seizing perths harpoon commanded his crew to grasp their oars and
stand by to stern

now by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis its
bow by anticipation was made to face the whales head while yet
under water but as if perceiving this stratagem moby dick with that
malicious intelligence ascribed to him sidelingly transplanted himself
as it were in an instant shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath
the boat

through and through through every plank and each rib it thrilled for
an instant the whale obliquely lying on his back in the manner of
a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his
mouth so that the long narrow scrolled lower jaw curled high up into
the open air and one of the teeth caught in a rowlock the bluish
pearlwhite of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of ahabs
head and reached higher than that in this attitude the white whale
now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse with
unastonished eyes fedallah gazed and crossed his arms but the
tigeryellow crew were tumbling over each others heads to gain the
uttermost stern

and now while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out as the
whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way and from his
body being submerged beneath the boat he could not be darted at from
the bows for the bows were almost inside of him as it were and
while the other boats involuntarily paused as before a quick crisis
impossible to withstand then it was that monomaniac ahab furious with
this tantalizing vicinity of his foe which placed him all alive and
helpless in the very jaws he hated frenzied with all this he seized
the long bone with his naked hands and wildly strove to wrench it from
its gripe as now he thus vainly strove the jaw slipped from him the
frail gunwales bent in collapsed and snapped as both jaws like an
enormous shears sliding further aft bit the craft completely in twain
and locked themselves fast again in the sea midway between the two
floating wrecks these floated aside the broken ends drooping the crew
at the sternwreck clinging to the gunwales and striving to hold fast
to the oars to lash them across

at that preluding moment ere the boat was yet snapped ahab the first
to perceive the whales intent by the crafty upraising of his head a
movement that loosed his hold for the time at that moment his hand
had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite but only
slipping further into the whales mouth and tilting over sideways as it
slipped the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw spilled him out of
it as he leaned to the push and so he fell flatfaced upon the sea

ripplingly withdrawing from his prey moby dick now lay at a little
distance vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the
billows and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body
so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rosesome twenty or more feet
out of the waterthe now rising swells with all their confluent waves
dazzlingly broke against it vindictively tossing their shivered spray
still higher into the air so in a gale the but half baffled channel
billows only recoil from the base of the eddystone triumphantly to
overleap its summit with their scud


this motion is peculiar to the sperm whale it receives its designation
pitchpoling from its being likened to that preliminary upanddown
poise of the whalelance in the exercise called pitchpoling previously
described by this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively
view whatever objects may be encircling him


but soon resuming his horizontal attitude moby dick swam swiftly round
and round the wrecked crew sideways churning the water in his vengeful
wake as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault
the sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him as the blood of
grapes and mulberries cast before antiochuss elephants in the book
of maccabees meanwhile ahab half smothered in the foam of the whales
insolent tail and too much of a cripple to swimthough he could still
keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that helpless
ahabs head was seen like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock
might burst from the boats fragmentary stern fedallah incuriously and
mildly eyed him the clinging crew at the other drifting end could not
succor him more than enough was it for them to look to themselves
for so revolvingly appalling was the white whales aspect and so
planetarily swift the evercontracting circles he made that he seemed
horizontally swooping upon them and though the other boats unharmed
still hovered hard by still they dared not pull into the eddy to
strike lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of
the jeopardized castaways ahab and all nor in that case could they
themselves hope to escape with straining eyes then they remained on
the outer edge of the direful zone whose centre had now become the old
mans head

meantime from the beginning all this had been descried from the ships
mast heads and squaring her yards she had borne down upon the scene
and was now so nigh that ahab in the water hailed hersail on
thebut that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from moby dick and
whelmed him for the time but struggling out of it again and chancing
to rise on a towering crest he shoutedsail on the whaledrive him
off

the pequods prows were pointed and breaking up the charmed circle she
effectually parted the white whale from his victim as he sullenly swam
off the boats flew to the rescue

dragged into stubbs boat with bloodshot blinded eyes the white brine
caking in his wrinkles the long tension of ahabs bodily strength did
crack and helplessly he yielded to his bodys doom for a time lying
all crushed in the bottom of stubbs boat like one trodden under foot
of herds of elephants far inland nameless wails came from him as
desolate sounds from out ravines

but this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more
abbreviate it in an instants compass great hearts sometimes condense
to one deep pang the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused
through feebler mens whole lives and so such hearts though summary
in each one suffering still if the gods decree it in their
lifetime aggregate a whole age of woe wholly made up of instantaneous
intensities for even in their pointless centres those noble natures
contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls

the harpoon said ahab half way rising and draggingly leaning on one
bended armis it safe

aye sir for it was not darted this is it said stubb showing it

lay it before meany missing men

one two three four fivethere were five oars sir and here are
five men

thats goodhelp me man i wish to stand so so i see him there
there going to leeward still what a leaping spouthands off from me
the eternal sap runs up in ahabs bones again set the sail out oars
the helm

it is often the case that when a boat is stove its crew being picked
up by another boat help to work that second boat and the chase is thus
continued with what is called doublebanked oars it was thus now but
the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale
for he seemed to have treblebanked his every fin swimming with a
velocity which plainly showed that if now under these circumstances
pushed on the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged if not a
hopeless one nor could any crew endure for so long a period such an
unintermitted intense straining at the oar a thing barely tolerable
only in some one brief vicissitude the ship itself then as it
sometimes happens offered the most promising intermediate means of
overtaking the chase accordingly the boats now made for her and were
soon swayed up to their cranesthe two parts of the wrecked boat having
been previously secured by herand then hoisting everything to her
side and stacking her canvas high up and sideways outstretching it
with stunsails like the doublejointed wings of an albatross the
pequod bore down in the leeward wake of mobydick at the well known
methodic intervals the whales glittering spout was regularly announced
from the manned mastheads and when he would be reported as just gone
down ahab would take the time and then pacing the deck binnaclewatch
in hand so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired his
voice was heardwhose is the doubloon now dye see him and if the
reply was no sir straightway he commanded them to lift him to his
perch in this way the day wore on ahab now aloft and motionless
anon unrestingly pacing the planks

as he was thus walking uttering no sound except to hail the men aloft
or to bid them hoist a sail still higher or to spread one to a still
greater breadththus to and fro pacing beneath his slouched hat at
every turn he passed his own wrecked boat which had been dropped upon
the quarterdeck and lay there reversed broken bow to shattered stern
at last he paused before it and as in an already overclouded sky fresh
troops of clouds will sometimes sail across so over the old mans face
there now stole some such added gloom as this

stubb saw him pause and perhaps intending not vainly though to
evince his own unabated fortitude and thus keep up a valiant place in
his captains mind he advanced and eyeing the wreck exclaimedthe
thistle the ass refused it pricked his mouth too keenly sir ha ha

what soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck man man did
i not know thee brave as fearless fire and as mechanical i could swear
thou wert a poltroon groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck

aye sir said starbuck drawing near tis a solemn sight an omen
and an ill one

omen omenthe dictionary if the gods think to speak outright to
man they will honourably speak outright not shake their heads and
give an old wives darkling hintbegone ye two are the opposite poles
of one thing starbuck is stubb reversed and stubb is starbuck and
ye two are all mankind and ahab stands alone among the millions of
the peopled earth nor gods nor men his neighbors cold coldi
shiverhow now aloft there dye see him sing out for every spout
though he spout ten times a second

the day was nearly done only the hem of his golden robe was rustling
soon it was almost dark but the lookout men still remained unset

cant see the spout now sirtoo darkcried a voice from the air

how heading when last seen

as before sirstraight to leeward

good he will travel slower now tis night down royals and topgallant
stunsails mr starbuck we must not run over him before morning hes
making a passage now and may heaveto a while helm there keep her
full before the windaloft come downmr stubb send a fresh hand
to the foremast head and see it manned till morningthen advancing
towards the doubloon in the mainmastmen this gold is mine for i
earned it but i shall let it abide here till the white whale is dead
and then whosoever of ye first raises him upon the day he shall be
killed this gold is that mans and if on that day i shall again raise
him then ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye away
nowthe deck is thine sir

and so saying he placed himself half way within the scuttle and
slouching his hat stood there till dawn except when at intervals
rousing himself to see how the night wore on



chapter 134 the chasesecond day


at daybreak the three mastheads were punctually manned afresh

dye see him cried ahab after allowing a little space for the light
to spread

see nothing sir

turn up all hands and make sail he travels faster than i thought
forthe topgallant sailsaye they should have been kept on her all
night but no mattertis but resting for the rush

here be it said that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale
continued through day into night and through night into day is a thing
by no means unprecedented in the south sea fishery for such is the
wonderful skill prescience of experience and invincible confidence
acquired by some great natural geniuses among the nantucket commanders
that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried they
will under certain given circumstances pretty accurately foretell both
the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time while out of
sight as well as his probable rate of progression during that period
and in these cases somewhat as a pilot when about losing sight of
a coast whose general trending he well knows and which he desires
shortly to return to again but at some further point like as this
pilot stands by his compass and takes the precise bearing of the
cape at present visible in order the more certainly to hit aright
the remote unseen headland eventually to be visited so does the
fisherman at his compass with the whale for after being chased and
diligently marked through several hours of daylight then when night
obscures the fish the creatures future wake through the darkness
is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter as the
pilots coast is to him so that to this hunters wondrous skill the
proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water a wake is to all
desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land and as the
mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in
its every pace that with watches in their hands men time his rate as
doctors that of a babys pulse and lightly say of it the up train or
the down train will reach such or such a spot at such or such an hour
even so almost there are occasions when these nantucketers time that
other leviathan of the deep according to the observed humor of his
speed and say to themselves so many hours hence this whale will have
gone two hundred miles will have about reached this or that degree of
latitude or longitude but to render this acuteness at all successful in
the end the wind and the sea must be the whalemans allies for of what
present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that
assures him he is exactly ninetythree leagues and a quarter from his
port inferable from these statements are many collateral subtile
matters touching the chase of whales

the ship tore on leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a
cannonball missent becomes a ploughshare and turns up the level
field

by salt and hemp cried stubb but this swift motion of the deck
creeps up ones legs and tingles at the heart this ship and i are two
brave fellowsha ha some one take me up and launch me spinewise
on the seafor by liveoaks my spines a keel ha ha we go the gait
that leaves no dust behind

there she blowsshe blowsshe blowsright ahead was now the
masthead cry

aye aye cried stubb i knew itye cant escapeblow on and
split your spout o whale the mad fiend himself is after ye blow your
trumpblister your lungsahab will dam off your blood as a miller
shuts his watergate upon the stream

and stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew the frenzies
of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up like old wine
worked anew whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might
have felt before these were not only now kept out of sight through the
growing awe of ahab but they were broken up and on all sides routed
as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison the hand
of fate had snatched all their souls and by the stirring perils of
the previous day the rack of the past nights suspense the fixed
unfearing blind reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging
towards its flying mark by all these things their hearts were bowled
along the wind that made great bellies of their sails and rushed the
vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible this seemed the symbol of
that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race

they were one man not thirty for as the one ship that held them all
though it was put together of all contrasting thingsoak and maple
and pine wood iron and pitch and hempyet all these ran into each
other in the one concrete hull which shot on its way both balanced and
directed by the long central keel even so all the individualities of
the crew this mans valor that mans fear guilt and guiltiness all
varieties were welded into oneness and were all directed to that fatal
goal which ahab their one lord and keel did point to

the rigging lived the mastheads like the tops of tall palms were
outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs clinging to a spar with one
hand some reached forth the other with impatient wavings others
shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight sat far out on the rocking
yards all the spars in full bearing of mortals ready and ripe for
their fate ah how they still strove through that infinite blueness to
seek out the thing that might destroy them

why sing ye not out for him if ye see him cried ahab when after
the lapse of some minutes since the first cry no more had been heard
sway me up men ye have been deceived not moby dick casts one odd jet
that way and then disappears

it was even so in their headlong eagerness the men had mistaken some
other thing for the whalespout as the event itself soon proved for
hardly had ahab reached his perch hardly was the rope belayed to its
pin on deck when he struck the keynote to an orchestra that made the
air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles the triumphant
halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard asmuch nearer to the ship
than the place of the imaginary jet less than a mile aheadmoby dick
bodily burst into view for not by any calm and indolent spoutings not
by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head did the white
whale now reveal his vicinity but by the far more wondrous phenomenon
of breaching rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths
the sperm whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of
air and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam shows his place to the
distance of seven miles and more in those moments the torn enraged
waves he shakes off seem his mane in some cases this breaching is his
act of defiance

there she breaches there she breaches was the cry as in his
immeasurable bravadoes the white whale tossed himself salmonlike to
heaven so suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea and relieved
against the still bluer margin of the sky the spray that he raised for
the moment intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier and
stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling
intensity to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale

aye breach your last to the sun moby dick cried ahab thy hour and
thy harpoon are at handdown down all of ye but one man at the fore
the boatsstand by

unmindful of the tedious ropeladders of the shrouds the men like
shooting stars slid to the deck by the isolated backstays and
halyards while ahab less dartingly but still rapidly was dropped from
his perch

lower away he cried so soon as he had reached his boata spare one
rigged the afternoon previous mr starbuck the ship is thinekeep
away from the boats but keep near them lower all

as if to strike a quick terror into them by this time being the first
assailant himself moby dick had turned and was now coming for the
three crews ahabs boat was central and cheering his men he told them
he would take the whale headandheadthat is pull straight up to his
foreheada not uncommon thing for when within a certain limit such
a course excludes the coming onset from the whales sidelong vision
but ere that close limit was gained and while yet all three boats were
plain as the ships three masts to his eye the white whale churning
himself into furious speed almost in an instant as it were rushing
among the boats with open jaws and a lashing tail offered appalling
battle on every side and heedless of the irons darted at him from every
boat seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which
those boats were made but skilfully manoeuvred incessantly wheeling
like trained chargers in the field the boats for a while eluded him
though at times but by a planks breadth while all the time ahabs
unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds

but at last in his untraceable evolutions the white whale so crossed
and recrossed and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three
lines now fast to him that they foreshortened and of themselves
warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him though now
for a moment the whale drew aside a little as if to rally for a more
tremendous charge seizing that opportunity ahab first paid out more
line and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it againhoping
that way to disencumber it of some snarlswhen loa sight more savage
than the embattled teeth of sharks

caught and twistedcorkscrewed in the mazes of the line loose harpoons
and lances with all their bristling barbs and points came flashing
and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of ahabs boat only one
thing could be done seizing the boatknife he critically reached
withinthroughand then withoutthe rays of steel dragged in
the line beyond passed it inboard to the bowsman and then twice
sundering the rope near the chocksdropped the intercepted fagot of
steel into the sea and was all fast again that instant the white
whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines
by so doing irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of stubb and
flask towards his flukes dashed them together like two rolling husks on
a surfbeaten beach and then diving down into the sea disappeared in
a boiling maelstrom in which for a space the odorous cedar chips of
the wrecks danced round and round like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly
stirred bowl of punch

while the two crews were yet circling in the waters reaching out after
the revolving linetubs oars and other floating furniture while
aslope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial twitching his
legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks and stubb was lustily
singing out for some one to ladle him up and while the old mans
linenow partingadmitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to
rescue whom he couldin that wild simultaneousness of a thousand
concreted perilsahabs yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards
heaven by invisible wiresas arrowlike shooting perpendicularly
from the sea the white whale dashed his broad forehead against its
bottom and sent it turning over and over into the air till it fell
againgunwale downwardsand ahab and his men struggled out from under
it like seals from a seaside cave

the first uprising momentum of the whalemodifying its direction as
he struck the surfaceinvoluntarily launched him along it to a little
distance from the centre of the destruction he had made and with his
back to it he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from
side to side and whenever a stray oar bit of plank the least chip
or crumb of the boats touched his skin his tail swiftly drew back and
came sideways smiting the sea but soon as if satisfied that his work
for that time was done he pushed his pleated forehead through the
ocean and trailing after him the intertangled lines continued his
leeward way at a travellers methodic pace

as before the attentive ship having descried the whole fight again
came bearing down to the rescue and dropping a boat picked up the
floating mariners tubs oars and whatever else could be caught at and
safely landed them on her decks some sprained shoulders wrists and
ankles livid contusions wrenched harpoons and lances inextricable
intricacies of rope shattered oars and planks all these were there
but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one as
with fedallah the day before so ahab was now found grimly clinging to
his boats broken half which afforded a comparatively easy float nor
did it so exhaust him as the previous days mishap

but when he was helped to the deck all eyes were fastened upon him as
instead of standing by himself he still halfhung upon the shoulder of
starbuck who had thus far been the foremost to assist him his ivory
leg had been snapped off leaving but one short sharp splinter

aye aye starbuck tis sweet to lean sometimes be the leaner who he
will and would old ahab had leaned oftener than he has

the ferrule has not stood sir said the carpenter now coming up i
put good work into that leg

but no bones broken sir i hope said stubb with true concern

aye and all splintered to pieces stubbdye see itbut even with
a broken bone old ahab is untouched and i account no living bone of
mine one jot more me than this dead one thats lost nor white whale
nor man nor fiend can so much as graze old ahab in his own proper and
inaccessible being can any lead touch yonder floor any mast scrape
yonder roofaloft there which way

dead to leeward sir

up helm then pile on the sail again ship keepers down the rest of
the spare boats and rig themmr starbuck away and muster the boats
crews

let me first help thee towards the bulwarks sir

oh oh oh how this splinter gores me now accursed fate that the
unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate

sir

my body man not thee give me something for a canethere that
shivered lance will do muster the men surely i have not seen him yet
by heaven it cannot bemissingquick call them all

the old mans hinted thought was true upon mustering the company the
parsee was not there

the parsee cried stubbhe must have been caught in

the black vomit wrench theerun all of ye above alow cabin
forecastlefind himnot gonenot gone

but quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the parsee was
nowhere to be found

aye sir said stubbcaught among the tangles of your linei
thought i saw him dragging under

my line my line gonegone what means that little wordwhat
deathknell rings in it that old ahab shakes as if he were the belfry

the unmeasured globe yea and dive straight through it but ill slay

great god but for one single instant show thyself cried starbuck
never never wilt thou capture him old manin jesus name no more of
this thats worse than devils madness two days chased twice stove
to splinters thy very leg once more snatched from under thee thy evil
shadow goneall good angels mobbing thee with warnings

what more wouldst thou haveshall we keep chasing this murderous fish
till he swamps the last man shall we be dragged by him to the bottom
of the sea shall we be towed by him to the infernal world oh
ohimpiety and blasphemy to hunt him more

starbuck of late ive felt strangely moved to thee ever since that
hour we both sawthou knowst what in one anothers eyes but in this
matter of the whale be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this
handa lipless unfeatured blank ahab is for ever ahab man this
whole acts immutably decreed twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion
years before this ocean rolled fool i am the fates lieutenant i act
under orders look thou underling that thou obeyest minestand round
me men ye see an old man cut down to the stump leaning on a shivered
lance propped up on a lonely foot tis ahabhis bodys part but
ahabs souls a centipede that moves upon a hundred legs i feel
strained half stranded as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale
and i may look so but ere i break yell hear me crack and till ye hear
that know that ahabs hawser tows his purpose yet believe ye men in
the things called omens then laugh aloud and cry encore for ere they
drown drowning things will twice rise to the surface then rise again
to sink for evermore so with moby dicktwo days hes floatedtomorrow
will be the third aye men hell rise once morebut only to spout
his last dye feel brave men brave

as fearless fire cried stubb

and as mechanical muttered ahab then as the men went forward he
muttered on the things called omens and yesterday i talked the same
to starbuck there concerning my broken boat oh how valiantly i seek
to drive out of others hearts whats clinched so fast in minethe
parseethe parseegone gone and he was to go beforebut still was
to be seen again ere i could perishhows thattheres a riddle now
might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line
of judgeslike a hawks beak it pecks my brain ill ill solve it
though

when dusk descended the whale was still in sight to leeward

so once more the sail was shortened and everything passed nearly as
on the previous night only the sound of hammers and the hum of the
grindstone was heard till nearly daylight as the men toiled by lanterns
in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening
their fresh weapons for the morrow meantime of the broken keel of
ahabs wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg while still as
on the night before slouched ahab stood fixed within his scuttle his
hid heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial sat due
eastward for the earliest sun



chapter 135 the chasethird day


the morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh and once more the
solitary nightman at the foremasthead was relieved by crowds of the
daylight lookouts who dotted every mast and almost every spar

dye see him cried ahab but the whale was not yet in sight

in his infallible wake though but follow that wake thats all helm
there steady as thou goest and hast been going what a lovely day
again were it a newmade world and made for a summerhouse to the
angels and this morning the first of its throwing open to them a
fairer day could not dawn upon that world heres food for thought had
ahab time to think but ahab never thinks he only feels feels feels
thats tingling enough for mortal man to thinks audacity god only has
that right and privilege thinking is or ought to be a coolness and a
calmness and our poor hearts throb and our poor brains beat too much
for that and yet ive sometimes thought my brain was very calmfrozen
calm this old skull cracks so like a glass in which the contents
turned to ice and shiver it and still this hair is growing now this
moment growing and heat must breed it but no its like that sort
of common grass that will grow anywhere between the earthy clefts of
greenland ice or in vesuvius lava how the wild winds blow it they whip
it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they
cling to a vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison
corridors and cells and wards of hospitals and ventilated them and
now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces out upon itits
tainted were i the wind id blow no more on such a wicked miserable
world id crawl somewhere to a cave and slink there and yet tis a
noble and heroic thing the wind who ever conquered it in every fight
it has the last and bitterest blow run tilting at it and you but run
through it ha a coward wind that strikes stark naked men but will not
stand to receive a single blow even ahab is a braver thinga nobler
thing than that would now the wind but had a body but all the things
that most exasperate and outrage mortal man all these things are
bodiless but only bodiless as objects not as agents theres a most
special a most cunning oh a most malicious difference and yet i
say again and swear it now that theres something all glorious and
gracious in the wind these warm trade winds at least that in the
clear heavens blow straight on in strong and steadfast vigorous
mildness and veer not from their mark however the baser currents of
the sea may turn and tack and mightiest mississippies of the land swift
and swerve about uncertain where to go at last and by the eternal
poles these same trades that so directly blow my good ship on these
trades or something like themsomething so unchangeable and full as
strong blow my keeled soul along to it aloft there what dye see

nothing sir

nothing and noon at hand the doubloon goes abegging see the sun
aye aye it must be so ive oversailed him how got the start aye
hes chasing me now not i himthats bad i might have known it too
fool the linesthe harpoons hes towing aye aye i have run him by
last night about about come down all of ye but the regular look
outs man the braces

steering as she had done the wind had been somewhat on the pequods
quarter so that now being pointed in the reverse direction the braced
ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own
white wake

against the wind he now steers for the open jaw murmured starbuck to
himself as he coiled the newhauled mainbrace upon the rail god keep
us but already my bones feel damp within me and from the inside wet my
flesh i misdoubt me that i disobey my god in obeying him

stand by to sway me up cried ahab advancing to the hempen basket
we should meet him soon

aye aye sir and straightway starbuck did ahabs bidding and once
more ahab swung on high

a whole hour now passed goldbeaten out to ages time itself now held
long breaths with keen suspense but at last some three points off the
weather bow ahab descried the spout again and instantly from the three
mastheads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced
it

forehead to forehead i meet thee this third time moby dick on deck
therebrace sharper up crowd her into the winds eye hes too
far off to lower yet mr starbuck the sails shake stand over that
helmsman with a topmaul so so he travels fast and i must down but
let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea theres
time for that an old old sight and yet somehow so young aye and
not changed a wink since i first saw it a boy from the sandhills of
nantucket the samethe samethe same to noah as to me theres
a soft shower to leeward such lovely leewardings they must lead
somewhereto something else than common land more palmy than the
palms leeward the white whale goes that way look to windward
then the better if the bitterer quarter but good bye good bye old
masthead whats thisgreen aye tiny mosses in these warped cracks
no such green weather stains on ahabs head theres the difference now
between mans old age and matters but aye old mast we both grow old
together sound in our hulls though are we not my ship aye minus
a leg thats all by heaven this dead wood has the better of my live
flesh every way i cant compare with it and ive known some ships made
of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of
vital fathers whats that he said he should still go before me my
pilot and yet to be seen again but where will i have eyes at the
bottom of the sea supposing i descend those endless stairs and all
night ive been sailing from him wherever he did sink to aye aye
like many more thou toldst direful truth as touching thyself o parsee
but ahab there thy shot fell short goodbye mastheadkeep a good
eye upon the whale the while im gone well talk tomorrow nay
tonight when the white whale lies down there tied by head and tail

he gave the word and still gazing round him was steadily lowered
through the cloven blue air to the deck

in due time the boats were lowered but as standing in his shallops
stern ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent he waved to the
matewho held one of the tackleropes on deckand bade him pause

starbuck

sir

for the third time my souls ship starts upon this voyage starbuck

aye sir thou wilt have it so

some ships sail from their ports and ever afterwards are missing
starbuck

truth sir saddest truth

some men die at ebb tide some at low water some at the full of
the floodand i feel now like a billow thats all one crested comb
starbuck i am oldshake hands with me man

their hands met their eyes fastened starbucks tears the glue

oh my captain my captainnoble heartgo notgo notsee its a
brave man that weeps how great the agony of the persuasion then

lower awaycried ahab tossing the mates arm from him stand by
the crew

in an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern

the sharks the sharks cried a voice from the low cabinwindow there
o master my master come back

but ahab heard nothing for his own voice was highlifted then and the
boat leaped on

yet the voice spake true for scarce had he pushed from the ship when
numbers of sharks seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath
the hull maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars every time they
dipped in the water and in this way accompanied the boat with their
bites it is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whaleboats in
those swarming seas the sharks at times apparently following them in
the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching
regiments in the east but these were the first sharks that had been
observed by the pequod since the white whale had been first descried
and whether it was that ahabs crew were all such tigeryellow
barbarians and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the
sharksa matter sometimes well known to affect themhowever it was
they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others

heart of wrought steel murmured starbuck gazing over the side and
following with his eyes the receding boatcanst thou yet ring boldly
to that sightlowering thy keel among ravening sharks and followed by
them openmouthed to the chase and this the critical third dayfor
when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit be sure
the first is the morning the second the noon and the third the evening
and the end of that thingbe that end what it may oh my god what
is this that shoots through me and leaves me so deadly calm yet
expectantfixed at the top of a shudder future things swim before me
as in empty outlines and skeletons all the past is somehow grown dim
mary girl thou fadest in pale glories behind me boy i seem to
see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue strangest problems of life seem
clearing but clouds sweep betweenis my journeys end coming my legs
feel faint like his who has footed it all day feel thy heartbeats
it yet stir thyself starbuckstave it offmove move
speak aloudmasthead there see ye my boys hand on the
hillcrazedaloft therekeep thy keenest eye upon the boats

mark well the whaleho againdrive off that hawk see he peckshe
tears the vanepointing to the red flag flying at the maintruckha
he soars away with itwheres the old man now seest thou that sight
oh ahabshudder shudder

the boats had not gone very far when by a signal from the mastheadsa
downward pointed arm ahab knew that the whale had sounded but
intending to be near him at the next rising he held on his way a little
sideways from the vessel the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest
silence as the headbeat waves hammered and hammered against the
opposing bow

drive drive in your nails oh ye waves to their uttermost heads
drive them in ye but strike a thing without a lid and no coffin and no
hearse can be mineand hemp only can kill me ha ha

suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles then
quickly upheaved as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of
ice swiftly rising to the surface a low rumbling sound was heard a
subterraneous hum and then all held their breaths as bedraggled with
trailing ropes and harpoons and lances a vast form shot lengthwise
but obliquely from the sea shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist it
hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air and then fell swamping back
into the deep crushed thirty feet upwards the waters flashed for
an instant like heaps of fountains then brokenly sank in a shower of
flakes leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the
marble trunk of the whale

give way cried ahab to the oarsmen and the boats darted forward to
the attack but maddened by yesterdays fresh irons that corroded in
him moby dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell
from heaven the wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad
white forehead beneath the transparent skin looked knitted together
as head on he came churning his tail among the boats and once more
flailed them apart spilling out the irons and lances from the two
mates boats and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows
but leaving ahabs almost without a scar

while daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained planks and as the
whale swimming out from them turned and showed one entire flank as he
shot by them again at that moment a quick cry went up lashed round
and round to the fishs back pinioned in the turns upon turns in which
during the past night the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines
around him the half torn body of the parsee was seen his sable raiment
frayed to shreds his distended eyes turned full upon old ahab

the harpoon dropped from his hand

befooled befooleddrawing in a long lean breathaye parsee i
see thee againaye and thou goest before and this this then is the
hearse that thou didst promise but i hold thee to the last letter of
thy word where is the second hearse away mates to the ship those
boats are useless now repair them if ye can in time and return to
me if not ahab is enough to diedown men the first thing that but
offers to jump from this boat i stand in that thing i harpoon ye are
not other men but my arms and my legs and so obey mewheres the
whale gone down again

but he looked too nigh the boat for as if bent upon escaping with the
corpse he bore and as if the particular place of the last encounter had
been but a stage in his leeward voyage moby dick was now again steadily
swimming forward and had almost passed the shipwhich thus far had
been sailing in the contrary direction to him though for the present
her headway had been stopped he seemed swimming with his utmost
velocity and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the
sea

oh ahab cried starbuck not too late is it even now the third
day to desist see moby dick seeks thee not it is thou thou that
madly seekest him

setting sail to the rising wind the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to
leeward by both oars and canvas and at last when ahab was sliding
by the vessel so near as plainly to distinguish starbucks face as he
leaned over the rail he hailed him to turn the vessel about and follow
him not too swiftly at a judicious interval glancing upwards he
saw tashtego queequeg and daggoo eagerly mounting to the three
mastheads while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats
which had but just been hoisted to the side and were busily at work in
repairing them one after the other through the portholes as he sped
he also caught flying glimpses of stubb and flask busying themselves
on deck among bundles of new irons and lances as he saw all this as he
heard the hammers in the broken boats far other hammers seemed driving
a nail into his heart but he rallied and now marking that the vane or
flag was gone from the mainmasthead he shouted to tashtego who had
just gained that perch to descend again for another flag and a hammer
and nails and so nail it to the mast

whether fagged by the three days running chase and the resistance
to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore or whether it was some
latent deceitfulness and malice in him whichever was true the white
whales way now began to abate as it seemed from the boat so rapidly
nearing him once more though indeed the whales last start had not been
so long a one as before and still as ahab glided over the waves the
unpitying sharks accompanied him and so pertinaciously stuck to the
boat and so continually bit at the plying oars that the blades became
jagged and crunched and left small splinters in the sea at almost
every dip

heed them not those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars pull on
tis the better rest the sharks jaw than the yielding water

but at every bite sir the thin blades grow smaller and smaller

they will last long enough pull onbut who can tellhe
mutteredwhether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on
ahabbut pull on aye all alive nowwe near him the helm take the
helm let me passand so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward
to the bows of the still flying boat

at length as the craft was cast to one side and ran ranging along
with the white whales flank he seemed strangely oblivious of its
advanceas the whale sometimes willand ahab was fairly within the
smoky mountain mist which thrown off from the whales spout curled
round his great monadnock hump he was even thus close to him when
with body arched back and both arms lengthwise highlifted to the
poise he darted his fierce iron and his far fiercer curse into the
hated whale as both steel and curse sank to the socket as if sucked
into a morass moby dick sideways writhed spasmodically rolled his nigh
flank against the bow and without staving a hole in it so suddenly
canted the boat over that had it not been for the elevated part of the
gunwale to which he then clung ahab would once more have been tossed
into the sea as it was three of the oarsmenwho foreknew not the
precise instant of the dart and were therefore unprepared for its
effectsthese were flung out but so fell that in an instant two of
them clutched the gunwale again and rising to its level on a combing
wave hurled themselves bodily inboard again the third man helplessly
dropping astern but still afloat and swimming

almost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduated
instantaneous swiftness the white whale darted through the weltering
sea but when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with
the line and hold it so and commanded the crew to turn round on their
seats and tow the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous line
felt that double strain and tug it snapped in the empty air

what breaks in me some sinew crackstis whole again oars oars
burst in upon him

hearing the tremendous rush of the seacrashing boat the whale wheeled
round to present his blank forehead at bay but in that evolution
catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship seemingly seeing
in it the source of all his persecutions bethinking itit may bea
larger and nobler foe of a sudden he bore down upon its advancing
prow smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam

ahab staggered his hand smote his forehead i grow blind hands
stretch out before me that i may yet grope my way ist night

the whale the ship cried the cringing oarsmen

oars oars slope downwards to thy depths o sea that ere it be for
ever too late ahab may slide this last last time upon his mark i see
the ship the ship dash on my men will ye not save my ship

but as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the
sledgehammering seas the before whalesmitten bowends of two planks
burst through and in an instant almost the temporarily disabled boat
lay nearly level with the waves its halfwading splashing crew trying
hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water

meantime for that one beholding instant tashtegos masthead hammer
remained suspended in his hand and the red flag halfwrapping him as
with a plaid then streamed itself straight out from him as his own
forwardflowing heart while starbuck and stubb standing upon the
bowsprit beneath caught sight of the downcoming monster just as soon
as he

the whale the whale up helm up helm oh all ye sweet powers of air
now hug me close let not starbuck die if die he must in a womans
fainting fit up helm i sayye fools the jaw the jaw is this the
end of all my bursting prayers all my lifelong fidelities oh ahab
ahab lo thy work steady helmsman steady nay nay up helm again
he turns to meet us oh his unappeasable brow drives on towards one
whose duty tells him he cannot depart my god stand by me now

stand not by me but stand under me whoever you are that will now help
stubb for stubb too sticks here i grin at thee thou grinning whale
who ever helped stubb or kept stubb awake but stubbs own unwinking
eye and now poor stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too
soft would it were stuffed with brushwood i grin at thee thou
grinning whale look ye sun moon and stars i call ye assassins of
as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost for all that i would yet
ring glasses with ye would ye but hand the cup oh oh oh oh thou
grinning whale but therell be plenty of gulping soon why fly ye
not o ahab for me off shoes and jacket to it let stubb die in
his drawers a most mouldy and over salted death thoughcherries
cherries cherries oh flask for one red cherry ere we die

cherries i only wish that we were where they grow oh stubb i hope
my poor mothers drawn my partpay ere this if not few coppers will
now come to her for the voyage is up

from the ships bows nearly all the seamen now hung inactive hammers
bits of plank lances and harpoons mechanically retained in their
hands just as they had darted from their various employments all their
enchanted eyes intent upon the whale which from side to side strangely
vibrating his predestinating head sent a broad band of overspreading
semicircular foam before him as he rushed retribution swift vengeance
eternal malice were in his whole aspect and spite of all that mortal
man could do the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ships
starboard bow till men and timbers reeled some fell flat upon their
faces like dislodged trucks the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook
on their bulllike necks through the breach they heard the waters
pour as mountain torrents down a flume

the ship the hearsethe second hearse cried ahab from the boat
its wood could only be american

diving beneath the settling ship the whale ran quivering along its
keel but turning under water swiftly shot to the surface again far
off the other bow but within a few yards of ahabs boat where for a
time he lay quiescent

i turn my body from the sun what ho tashtego let me hear thy hammer
oh ye three unsurrendered spires of mine thou uncracked keel and only
godbullied hull thou firm deck and haughty helm and polepointed
prowdeathglorious ship must ye then perish and without me am i
cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains oh
lonely death on lonely life oh now i feel my topmost greatness lies in
my topmost grief ho ho from all your furthest bounds pour ye now in
ye bold billows of my whole foregone life and top this one piled comber
of my death towards thee i roll thou alldestroying but unconquering
whale to the last i grapple with thee from hells heart i stab at
thee for hates sake i spit my last breath at thee sink all coffins
and all hearses to one common pool and since neither can be mine let
me then tow to pieces while still chasing thee though tied to thee
thou damned whale thus i give up the spear

the harpoon was darted the stricken whale flew forward with igniting
velocity the line ran through the groovesran foul ahab stooped to
clear it he did clear it but the flying turn caught him round the
neck and voicelessly as turkish mutes bowstring their victim he was
shot out of the boat ere the crew knew he was gone next instant the
heavy eyesplice in the ropes final end flew out of the starkempty
tub knocked down an oarsman and smiting the sea disappeared in its
depths

for an instant the tranced boats crew stood still then turned the
ship great god where is the ship soon they through dim bewildering
mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom as in the gaseous fata morgana
only the uppermost masts out of water while fixed by infatuation or
fidelity or fate to their once lofty perches the pagan harpooneers
still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea and now concentric
circles seized the lone boat itself and all its crew and each floating
oar and every lancepole and spinning animate and inanimate all
round and round in one vortex carried the smallest chip of the pequod
out of sight

but as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the
sunken head of the indian at the mainmast leaving a few inches of the
erect spar yet visible together with long streaming yards of the flag
which calmly undulated with ironical coincidings over the destroying
billows they almost touchedat that instant a red arm and a hammer
hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air in the act of nailing
the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar a skyhawk that
tauntingly had followed the maintruck downwards from its natural home
among the stars pecking at the flag and incommoding tashtego there
this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the
hammer and the wood and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill
the submerged savage beneath in his deathgasp kept his hammer frozen
there and so the bird of heaven with archangelic shrieks and his
imperial beak thrust upwards and his whole captive form folded in the
flag of ahab went down with his ship which like satan would not sink
to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her and
helmeted herself with it

now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf a sullen white
surf beat against its steep sides then all collapsed and the great
shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago




epilogue

and i only am escaped alone to tell thee job

the dramas done why then here does any one step forthbecause one
did survive the wreck

it so chanced that after the parsees disappearance i was he whom the
fates ordained to take the place of ahabs bowsman when that bowsman
assumed the vacant post the same who when on the last day the three
men were tossed from out of the rocking boat was dropped astern so
floating on the margin of the ensuing scene and in full sight of it
when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me i was then
but slowly drawn towards the closing vortex when i reached it it had
subsided to a creamy pool round and round then and ever contracting
towards the buttonlike black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling
circle like another ixion i did revolve till gaining that vital
centre the black bubble upward burst and now liberated by reason of
its cunning spring and owing to its great buoyancy rising with great
force the coffin lifebuoy shot lengthwise from the sea fell over and
floated by my side buoyed up by that coffin for almost one whole day
and night i floated on a soft and dirgelike main the unharming sharks
they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths the savage seahawks
sailed with sheathed beaks on the second day a sail drew near nearer
and picked me up at last it was the deviouscruising rachel that in
her retracing search after her missing children only found another
orphan
