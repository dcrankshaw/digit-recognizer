moby dick or the whale
by herman melville
chapter  loomings
call me ishmael some years agonever mind how long preciselyhaving
little or no money in my purse and nothing particular to interest me on
shore i thought i would sail about a little and see the watery part of
the world it is a way i have of driving off the spleen and regulating
the circulation whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth
whenever it is a damp drizzly november in my soul whenever i find
myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses and bringing up
the rear of every funeral i meet and especially whenever my hypos get
such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to
prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and methodically
knocking peoples hats offthen i account it high time to get to sea
as soon as i can this is my substitute for pistol and ball with a
philosophical flourish cato throws himself upon his sword i quietly
take to the ship there is nothing surprising in this if they but knew
it almost all men in their degree some time or other cherish very
nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me

there now is your insular city of the manhattoes belted round by
wharves as indian isles by coral reefscommerce surrounds it with
her surf right and left the streets take you waterward its extreme
downtown is the battery where that noble mole is washed by waves and
cooled by breezes which a few hours previous were out of sight of land
look at the crowds of watergazers there

circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go from corlears
hook to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what
do you seeposted like silent sentinels all around the town stand
thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries some
leaning against the spiles some seated upon the pierheads some
looking over the bulwarks of ships from china some high aloft in the
rigging as if striving to get a still better seaward peep but these
are all landsmen of week days pent up in lath and plastertied to
counters nailed to benches clinched to desks how then is this are
the green fields gone what do they here

but look here come more crowds pacing straight for the water and
seemingly bound for a dive strange nothing will content them but the
extremest limit of the land loitering under the shady lee of yonder
warehouses will not suffice no they must get just as nigh the water
as they possibly can without falling in and there they standmiles of
themleagues inlanders all they come from lanes and alleys streets
and avenuesnorth east south and west yet here they all unite
tell me does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all
those ships attract them thither

once more say you are in the country in some high land of lakes take
almost any path you please and ten to one it carries you down in a
dale and leaves you there by a pool in the stream there is magic
in it let the most absentminded of men be plunged in his deepest
reveriesstand that man on his legs set his feet agoing and he will
infallibly lead you to water if water there be in all that region
should you ever be athirst in the great american desert try this
experiment if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical
professor yes as every one knows meditation and water are wedded for
ever

but here is an artist he desires to paint you the dreamiest shadiest
quietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of
the saco what is the chief element he employs there stand his trees
each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and a crucifix were within and
here sleeps his meadow and there sleep his cattle and up from yonder
cottage goes a sleepy smoke deep into distant woodlands winds a
mazy way reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their
hillside blue but though the picture lies thus tranced and though
this pinetree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherds
head yet all were vain unless the shepherds eye were fixed upon the
magic stream before him go visit the prairies in june when for scores
on scores of miles you wade kneedeep among tigerlilieswhat is the
one charm wantingwaterthere is not a drop of water there were
niagara but a cataract of sand would you travel your thousand miles to
see it why did the poor poet of tennessee upon suddenly receiving two
handfuls of silver deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly
needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why
is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him at
some time or other crazy to go to sea why upon your first voyage as a
passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first
told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land why did the
old persians hold the sea holy why did the greeks give it a separate
deity and own brother of jove surely all this is not without meaning
and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because
he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain
plunged into it and was drowned but that same image we ourselves see
in all rivers and oceans it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of
life and this is the key to it all

now when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin
to grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be over conscious of my lungs
i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as a passenger
for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse and a purse is
but a rag unless you have something in it besides passengers get
seasickgrow quarrelsomedont sleep of nightsdo not enjoy
themselves much as a general thingno i never go as a passenger
nor though i am something of a salt do i ever go to sea as a
commodore or a captain or a cook i abandon the glory and distinction
of such offices to those who like them for my part i abominate all
honourable respectable toils trials and tribulations of every kind
whatsoever it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself
without taking care of ships barques brigs schooners and what not
and as for going as cookthough i confess there is considerable glory
in that a cook being a sort of officer on shipboardyet somehow
i never fancied broiling fowlsthough once broiled judiciously
buttered and judgmatically salted and peppered there is no one who
will speak more respectfully not to say reverentially of a broiled
fowl than i will it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old
egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the
mummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramids

no when i go to sea i go as a simple sailor right before the mast
plumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal masthead
true they rather order me about some and make me jump from spar to
spar like a grasshopper in a may meadow and at first this sort
of thing is unpleasant enough it touches ones sense of honour
particularly if you come of an old established family in the land the
van rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all
if just previous to putting your hand into the tarpot you have been
lording it as a country schoolmaster making the tallest boys stand
in awe of you the transition is a keen one i assure you from a
schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of seneca and
the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it but even this wears off in
time

what of it if some old hunks of a seacaptain orders me to get a broom
and sweep down the decks what does that indignity amount to weighed
i mean in the scales of the new testament do you think the archangel
gabriel thinks anything the less of me because i promptly and
respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance who aint
a slave tell me that well then however the old seacaptains may
order me abouthowever they may thump and punch me about i have the
satisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is
one way or other served in much the same wayeither in a physical
or metaphysical point of view that is and so the universal thump is
passed round and all hands should rub each others shoulderblades and
be content

again i always go to sea as a sailor because they make a point of
paying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passengers a single
penny that i ever heard of on the contrary passengers themselves must
pay and there is all the difference in the world between paying
and being paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable
infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us but being
paidwhat will compare with it the urbane activity with which a man
receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly
believe money to be the root of all earthly ills and that on no account
can a monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully we consign ourselves
to perdition

finally i always go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesome
exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck for as in this world
head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern that is
if you never violate the pythagorean maxim so for the most part the
commodore on the quarterdeck gets his atmosphere at second hand from
the sailors on the forecastle he thinks he breathes it first but not
so in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many
other things at the same time that the leaders little suspect it
but wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a
merchant sailor i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling
voyage this the invisible police officer of the fates who has the
constant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me and influences me
in some unaccountable wayhe can better answer than any one else and
doubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand
programme of providence that was drawn up a long time ago it came in as
a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances
i take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this


grand contested election for the presidency of the united states

whaling voyage by one ishmael

bloody battle in affghanistan


though i cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers the
fates put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage when others
were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies and short and
easy parts in genteel comedies and jolly parts in farcesthough
i cannot tell why this was exactly yet now that i recall all the
circumstances i think i can see a little into the springs and motives
which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises induced
me to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into the
delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill
and discriminating judgment

chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great
whale himself such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my
curiosity then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island
bulk the undeliverable nameless perils of the whale these with all
the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds helped
to sway me to my wish with other men perhaps such things would not
have been inducements but as for me i am tormented with an everlasting
itch for things remote i love to sail forbidden seas and land on
barbarous coasts not ignoring what is good i am quick to perceive a
horror and could still be social with itwould they let mesince it
is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place
one lodges in

by reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome the
great floodgates of the wonderworld swung open and in the wild
conceits that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into
my inmost soul endless processions of the whale and mid most of them
all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air



chapter  the carpetbag


i stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpetbag tucked it under my arm
and started for cape horn and the pacific quitting the good city of
old manhatto i duly arrived in new bedford it was a saturday night in
december much was i disappointed upon learning that the little packet
for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reaching that place
would offer till the following monday

as most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at
this same new bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may as well
be related that i for one had no idea of so doing for my mind was
made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft because there was a
fine boisterous something about everything connected with that famous
old island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford has
of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling and though
in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her yet nantucket
was her great originalthe tyre of this carthagethe place where the
first dead american whale was stranded where else but from nantucket
did those aboriginal whalemen the redmen first sally out in canoes to
give chase to the leviathan and where but from nantucket too did that
first adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with imported
cobblestonesso goes the storyto throw at the whales in order to
discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit

now having a night a day and still another night following before me
in new bedford ere i could embark for my destined port it became a
matter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile it was a
very dubiouslooking nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly cold
and cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnels i had
sounded my pocket and only brought up a few pieces of silverso
wherever you go ishmael said i to myself as i stood in the middle of
a dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the
north with the darkness towards the southwherever in your wisdom you
may conclude to lodge for the night my dear ishmael be sure to inquire
the price and dont be too particular

with halting steps i paced the streets and passed the sign of the
crossed harpoonsbut it looked too expensive and jolly there further
on from the bright red windows of the swordfish inn there came such
fervent rays that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from
before the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches
thick in a hard asphaltic pavementrather weary for me when i struck
my foot against the flinty projections because from hard remorseless
service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight too
expensive and jolly again thought i pausing one moment to watch the
broad glare in the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses
within but go on ishmael said i at last dont you hear get away
from before the door your patched boots are stopping the way so on i
went i now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward for
there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest inns

such dreary streets blocks of blackness not houses on either hand
and here and there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb at
this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of
the town proved all but deserted but presently i came to a smoky light
proceeding from a low wide building the door of which stood invitingly
open it had a careless look as if it were meant for the uses of the
public so entering the first thing i did was to stumble over an
ashbox in the porch ha thought i ha as the flying particles almost
choked me are these ashes from that destroyed city gomorrah but the
crossed harpoons and the swordfishthis then must needs be the
sign of the trap however i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice
within pushed on and opened a second interior door

it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundred black
faces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black angel
of doom was beating a book in a pulpit it was a negro church and the
preachers text was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and
wailing and teethgnashing there ha ishmael muttered i backing out
wretched entertainment at the sign of the trap

moving on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks
and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging
sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing
a tall straight jet of misty spray and these words underneaththe
spouter innpeter coffin

coffinspouterrather ominous in that particular connexion thought
i but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i suppose this
peter here is an emigrant from there as the light looked so dim and
the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little
wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from
the ruins of some burnt district and as the swinging sign had a
povertystricken sort of creak to it i thought that here was the very
spot for cheap lodgings and the best of pea coffee

it was a queer sort of placea gableended old house one side palsied
as it were and leaning over sadly it stood on a sharp bleak corner
where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever
it did about poor pauls tossed craft euroclydon nevertheless is a
mighty pleasant zephyr to any one indoors with his feet on the hob
quietly toasting for bed in judging of that tempestuous wind called
euroclydon says an old writerof whose works i possess the only copy
extantit maketh a marvellous difference whether thou lookest out at
it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside or whether
thou observest it from that sashless window where the frost is on both
sides and of which the wight death is the only glazier true enough
thought i as this passage occurred to my mindold blackletter thou
reasonest well yes these eyes are windows and this body of mine is
the house what a pity they didnt stop up the chinks and the crannies
though and thrust in a little lint here and there but its too late
to make any improvements now the universe is finished the copestone
is on and the chips were carted off a million years ago poor lazarus
there chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow and
shaking off his tatters with his shiverings he might plug up both ears
with rags and put a corncob into his mouth and yet that would not
keep out the tempestuous euroclydon euroclydon says old dives in his
red silken wrapperhe had a redder one afterwards pooh pooh what
a fine frosty night how orion glitters what northern lights let them
talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories give
me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals

but what thinks lazarus can he warm his blue hands by holding them up
to the grand northern lights would not lazarus rather be in sumatra
than here would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the
line of the equator yea ye gods go down to the fiery pit itself in
order to keep out this frost

now that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the
door of dives this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be
moored to one of the moluccas yet dives himself he too lives like a
czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and being a president of a
temperance society he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans

but no more of this blubbering now we are going awhaling and there is
plenty of that yet to come let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet
and see what sort of a place this spouter may be



chapter  the spouterinn


entering that gableended spouterinn you found yourself in a wide
low straggling entry with oldfashioned wainscots reminding one of
the bulwarks of some condemned old craft on one side hung a very large
oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the
unequal crosslights by which you viewed it it was only by diligent
study and a series of systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of
the neighbors that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its
purpose such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that at first
you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new
england hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched but by dint
of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and
especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the
entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however
wild might not be altogether unwarranted

but what most puzzled and confounded you was a long limber portentous
black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three
blue dim perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast a boggy
soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distracted
yet was there a sort of indefinite halfattained unimaginable
sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it till you involuntarily
took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting
meant ever and anon a bright but alas deceptive idea would dart you
throughits the black sea in a midnight galeits the unnatural
combat of the four primal elementsits a blasted heathits a
hyperborean winter sceneits the breakingup of the icebound stream
of time but at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous
something in the pictures midst that once found out and all the rest
were plain but stop does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic
fish even the great leviathan himself

in fact the artists design seemed this a final theory of my own
partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom
i conversed upon the subject the picture represents a capehorner in a
great hurricane the halffoundered ship weltering there with its three
dismantled masts alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to
spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act of impaling himself
upon the three mastheads

the opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish
array of monstrous clubs and spears some were thickly set with
glittering teeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted with knots of
human hair and one was sickleshaped with a vast handle sweeping round
like the segment made in the newmown grass by a longarmed mower you
shuddered as you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage
could ever have gone a deathharvesting with such a hacking horrifying
implement mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons
all broken and deformed some were storied weapons with this once long
lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago did nathan swain kill fifteen
whales between a sunrise and a sunset and that harpoonso like a
corkscrew nowwas flung in javan seas and run away with by a whale
years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco the original iron entered
nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a
man travelled full forty feet and at last was found imbedded in the
hump

crossing this dusky entry and on through yon lowarched waycut
through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with
fireplaces all roundyou enter the public room a still duskier place
is this with such low ponderous beams above and such old wrinkled
planks beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old crafts
cockpits especially of such a howling night when this corneranchored
old ark rocked so furiously on one side stood a long low shelflike
table covered with cracked glass cases filled with dusty rarities
gathered from this wide worlds remotest nooks projecting from the
further angle of the room stands a darklooking denthe bara rude
attempt at a right whales head be that how it may there stands the
vast arched bone of the whales jaw so wide a coach might almost drive
beneath it within are shabby shelves ranged round with old decanters
bottles flasks and in those jaws of swift destruction like another
cursed jonah by which name indeed they called him bustles a little
withered old man who for their money dearly sells the sailors
deliriums and death

abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison though
true cylinders withoutwithin the villanous green goggling glasses
deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom parallel meridians
rudely pecked into the glass surround these footpads goblets fill to
this mark and your charge is but a penny to this a penny more and so
on to the full glassthe cape horn measure which you may gulp down for
a shilling

upon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about
a table examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander i
sought the landlord and telling him i desired to be accommodated with a
room received for answer that his house was fullnot a bed unoccupied
but avast he added tapping his forehead you haint no objections
to sharing a harpooneers blanket have ye i spose you are goin
awhalin so youd better get used to that sort of thing

i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if i should
ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and
that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the
harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander
further about a strange town on so bitter a night i would put up with
the half of any decent mans blanket

i thought so all right take a seat supperyou want supper
supperll be ready directly

i sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the
battery at one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with
his jackknife stooping over and diligently working away at the space
between his legs he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail but
he didnt make much headway i thought

at last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an
adjoining room it was cold as icelandno fire at allthe landlord
said he couldnt afford it nothing but two dismal tallow candles each
in a winding sheet we were fain to button up our monkey jackets and
hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers but
the fare was of the most substantial kindnot only meat and potatoes
but dumplings good heavens dumplings for supper one young fellow in
a green box coat addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful
manner

my boy said the landlord youll have the nightmare to a dead
sartainty

landlord i whispered that aint the harpooneer is it

oh no said he looking a sort of diabolically funny the harpooneer
is a dark complexioned chap he never eats dumplings he donthe eats
nothing but steaks and he likes em rare

the devil he does says i where is that harpooneer is he here

hell be here afore long was the answer

i could not help it but i began to feel suspicious of this dark
complexioned harpooneer at any rate i made up my mind that if it so
turned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get into
bed before i did

supper over the company went back to the barroom when knowing not
what else to do with myself i resolved to spend the rest of the evening
as a looker on

presently a rioting noise was heard without starting up the landlord
cried thats the grampuss crew i seed her reported in the offing
this morning a three years voyage and a full ship hurrah boys now
well have the latest news from the feegees

a tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry the door was flung open
and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough enveloped in their shaggy
watch coats and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters all
bedarned and ragged and their beards stiff with icicles they seemed an
eruption of bears from labrador they had just landed from their boat
and this was the first house they entered no wonder then that they
made a straight wake for the whales mouththe barwhen the wrinkled
little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all
round one complained of a bad cold in his head upon which jonah
mixed him a pitchlike potion of gin and molasses which he swore was a
sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever never mind of how
long standing or whether caught off the coast of labrador or on the
weather side of an iceisland

the liquor soon mounted into their heads as it generally does even
with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea and they began capering
about most obstreperously

i observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and though
he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own
sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise
as the rest this man interested me at once and since the seagods
had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a
sleepingpartner one so far as this narrative is concerned i will
here venture upon a little description of him he stood full six feet
in height with noble shoulders and a chest like a cofferdam i have
seldom seen such brawn in a man his face was deeply brown and burnt
making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while in the deep
shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give
him much joy his voice at once announced that he was a southerner
and from his fine stature i thought he must be one of those tall
mountaineers from the alleghanian ridge in virginia when the revelry
of his companions had mounted to its height this man slipped away
unobserved and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the
sea in a few minutes however he was missed by his shipmates and
being it seems for some reason a huge favourite with them they raised
a cry of bulkington bulkington wheres bulkington and darted out of
the house in pursuit of him

it was now about nine oclock and the room seeming almost
supernaturally quiet after these orgies i began to congratulate myself
upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance
of the seamen

no man prefers to sleep two in a bed in fact you would a good deal
rather not sleep with your own brother i dont know how it is but
people like to be private when they are sleeping and when it comes to
sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange
town and that stranger a harpooneer then your objections indefinitely
multiply nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should
sleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailors no more sleep
two in a bed at sea than bachelor kings do ashore to be sure they
all sleep together in one apartment but you have your own hammock and
cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin

the more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i abominated the
thought of sleeping with him it was fair to presume that being a
harpooneer his linen or woollen as the case might be would not be of
the tidiest certainly none of the finest i began to twitch all over
besides it was getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be
home and going bedwards suppose now he should tumble in upon me at
midnighthow could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming

landlord ive changed my mind about that harpooneeri shant sleep
with him ill try the bench here

just as you please im sorry i cant spare ye a tablecloth for a
mattress and its a plaguy rough board herefeeling of the knots and
notches but wait a bit skrimshander ive got a carpenters plane
there in the barwait i say and ill make ye snug enough so saying
he procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting
the bench vigorously set to planing away at my bed the while grinning
like an ape the shavings flew right and left till at last the
planeiron came bump against an indestructible knot the landlord was
near spraining his wrist and i told him for heavens sake to quitthe
bed was soft enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planing
in the world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up the
shavings with another grin and throwing them into the great stove in
the middle of the room he went about his business and left me in a
brown study

i now took the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot too
short but that could be mended with a chair but it was a foot too
narrow and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher
than the planed oneso there was no yoking them i then placed the
first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall
leaving a little interval between for my back to settle down in but i
soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under
the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all especially
as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window
and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate
vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the night

the devil fetch that harpooneer thought i but stop couldnt i steal
a march on himbolt his door inside and jump into his bed not to be
wakened by the most violent knockings it seemed no bad idea but upon
second thoughts i dismissed it for who could tell but what the next
morning so soon as i popped out of the room the harpooneer might be
standing in the entry all ready to knock me down

still looking round me again and seeing no possible chance of spending
a sufferable night unless in some other persons bed i began to think
that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against
this unknown harpooneer thinks i ill wait awhile he must be dropping
in before long ill have a good look at him then and perhaps we may
become jolly good bedfellows after alltheres no telling

but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones twos and threes
and going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer

landlord said i what sort of a chap is hedoes he always keep such
late hours it was now hard upon twelve oclock

the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle and seemed to
be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension no he
answered generally hes an early birdairley to bed and airley to
riseyes hes the bird what catches the worm but tonight he went out
a peddling you see and i dont see what on airth keeps him so late
unless may be he cant sell his head

cant sell his headwhat sort of a bamboozingly story is this you
are telling me getting into a towering rage do you pretend to say
landlord that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed saturday
night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head around this town

thats precisely it said the landlord and i told him he couldnt
sell it here the markets overstocked

with what shouted i

with heads to be sure aint there too many heads in the world

i tell you what it is landlord said i quite calmly youd better
stop spinning that yarn to meim not green

may be not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick but i
rayther guess youll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a
slanderin his head

ill break it for him said i now flying into a passion again at this
unaccountable farrago of the landlords

its broke aready said he

broke said ibroke do you mean

sartain and thats the very reason he cant sell it i guess

landlord said i going up to him as cool as mt hecla in a
snowstormlandlord stop whittling you and i must understand one
another and that too without delay i come to your house and want a
bed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half
belongs to a certain harpooneer and about this harpooneer whom i
have not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and
exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling
towards the man whom you design for my bedfellowa sort of connexion
landlord which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest
degree i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this
harpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respects safe to spend the
night with him and in the first place you will be so good as to unsay
that story about selling his head which if true i take to be good
evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and ive no idea of sleeping
with a madman and you sir you i mean landlord you sir by trying
to induce me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable to
a criminal prosecution

wall said the landlord fetching a long breath thats a purty long
sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then but be easy be easy
this here harpooneer i have been tellin you of has just arrived from
the south seas where he bought up a lot of balmed new zealand heads
great curios you know and hes sold all on em but one and that one
hes trying to sell tonight cause tomorrows sunday and it would not
do to be sellin human heads about the streets when folks is goin to
churches he wanted to last sunday but i stopped him just as he was
goin out of the door with four heads strung on a string for all the
airth like a string of inions

this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed
that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling mebut at
the same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a
saturday night clean into the holy sabbath engaged in such a cannibal
business as selling the heads of dead idolators

depend upon it landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous man

he pays reglar was the rejoinder but come its getting dreadful
late you had better be turning flukesits a nice bed sal and me
slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced theres plenty of room
for two to kick about in that bed its an almighty big bed that why
afore we give it up sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the
foot of it but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night and
somehow sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his arm
arter that sal said it wouldnt do come along here ill give ye a
glim in a jiffy and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards
me offering to lead the way but i stood irresolute when looking at a
clock in the corner he exclaimed i vum its sundayyou wont see that
harpooneer tonight hes come to anchor somewherecome along then do
come wont ye come

i considered the matter a moment and then up stairs we went and i was
ushered into a small room cold as a clam and furnished sure enough
with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers
to sleep abreast

there said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest
that did double duty as a washstand and centre table there make
yourself comfortable now and good night to ye i turned round from
eyeing the bed but he had disappeared

folding back the counterpane i stooped over the bed though none of the
most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well i then glanced
round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see
no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf the four
walls and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale of
things not properly belonging to the room there was a hammock lashed
up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a large seamans bag
containing the harpooneers wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk
likewise there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf
over the fireplace and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed

but what is this on the chest i took it up and held it close to the
light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive
at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it i can compare it to
nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edges with little
tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an
indian moccasin there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat
as you see the same in south american ponchos but could it be possible
that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the
streets of any christian town in that sort of guise i put it on to try
it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and
thick and i thought a little damp as though this mysterious harpooneer
had been wearing it of a rainy day i went up in it to a bit of glass
stuck against the wall and i never saw such a sight in my life i tore
myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck

i sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this
headpeddling harpooneer and his door mat after thinking some time on
the bedside i got up and took off my monkey jacket and then stood in
the middle of the room thinking i then took off my coat and thought
a little more in my shirt sleeves but beginning to feel very cold now
half undressed as i was and remembering what the landlord said about
the harpooneers not coming home at all that night it being so very
late i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots and
then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself to the
care of heaven

whether that mattress was stuffed with corncobs or broken crockery
there is no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could not sleep
for a long time at last i slid off into a light doze and had pretty
nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod when i heard a heavy
footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room
from under the door

lord save me thinks i that must be the harpooneer the infernal
headpeddler but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word
till spoken to holding a light in one hand and that identical new
zealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and without
looking towards the bed placed his candle a good way off from me on the
floor in one corner and then began working away at the knotted cords
of the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room i was all
eagerness to see his face but he kept it averted for some time while
employed in unlacing the bags mouth this accomplished however he
turned roundwhen good heavens what a sight such a face it was of
a dark purplish yellow colour here and there stuck over with large
blackish looking squares yes its just as i thought hes a terrible
bedfellow hes been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he is
just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanced to turn his face
so towards the light that i plainly saw they could not be
stickingplasters at all those black squares on his cheeks they were
stains of some sort or other at first i knew not what to make of this
but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me i remembered a story of
a white mana whaleman toowho falling among the cannibals had been
tattooed by them i concluded that this harpooneer in the course of his
distant voyages must have met with a similar adventure and what is it
thought i after all its only his outside a man can be honest in any
sort of skin but then what to make of his unearthly complexion that
part of it i mean lying round about and completely independent of the
squares of tattooing to be sure it might be nothing but a good coat of
tropical tanning but i never heard of a hot suns tanning a white man
into a purplish yellow one however i had never been in the south seas
and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the
skin now while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning
this harpooneer never noticed me at all but after some difficulty
having opened his bag he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled
out a sort of tomahawk and a sealskin wallet with the hair on placing
these on the old chest in the middle of the room he then took the new
zealand heada ghastly thing enoughand crammed it down into the bag
he now took off his hata new beaver hatwhen i came nigh singing out
with fresh surprise there was no hair on his headnone to speak of at
leastnothing but a small scalpknot twisted up on his forehead his
bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull
had not the stranger stood between me and the door i would have bolted
out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner

even as it was i thought something of slipping out of the window but
it was the second floor back i am no coward but what to make of
this headpeddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension
ignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed and
confounded about the stranger i confess i was now as much afraid of him
as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at
the dead of night in fact i was so afraid of him that i was not
game enough just then to address him and demand a satisfactory answer
concerning what seemed inexplicable in him

meanwhile he continued the business of undressing and at last showed
his chest and arms as i live these covered parts of him were checkered
with the same squares as his face his back too was all over the same
dark squares he seemed to have been in a thirty years war and just
escaped from it with a stickingplaster shirt still more his very
legs were marked as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up
the trunks of young palms it was now quite plain that he must be some
abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south
seas and so landed in this christian country i quaked to think of it
a peddler of heads tooperhaps the heads of his own brothers he might
take a fancy to mineheavens look at that tomahawk

but there was no time for shuddering for now the savage went about
something that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me that
he must indeed be a heathen going to his heavy grego or wrapall or
dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he fumbled in the
pockets and produced at length a curious little deformed image with
a hunch on its back and exactly the colour of a three days old congo
baby remembering the embalmed head at first i almost thought that
this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner but
seeing that it was not at all limber and that it glistened a good deal
like polished ebony i concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden
idol which indeed it proved to be for now the savage goes up to the
empty fireplace and removing the papered fireboard sets up this
little hunchbacked image like a tenpin between the andirons the
chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty so that i
thought this fireplace made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel
for his congo idol

i now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image feeling but
ill at ease meantimeto see what was next to follow first he takes
about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket and places
them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of ship biscuit on
top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shavings into
a sacrificial blaze presently after many hasty snatches into the fire
and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers whereby he seemed to be
scorching them badly he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit
then blowing off the heat and ashes a little he made a polite offer of
it to the little negro but the little devil did not seem to fancy such
dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lips all these strange
antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the
devotee who seemed to be praying in a singsong or else singing some
pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the
most unnatural manner at last extinguishing the fire he took the idol
up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocket as
carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock

all these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness and
seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business
operations and jumping into bed with me i thought it was high time
now or never before the light was put out to break the spell in which
i had so long been bound

but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say was a fatal one
taking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head of it for an
instant and then holding it to the light with his mouth at the handle
he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke the next moment the light
was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth
sprang into bed with me i sang out i could not help it now and giving
a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me

stammering out something i knew not what i rolled away from him
against the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he might
be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again but his
guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my
meaning

whoe debel youhe at last saidyou no speake damme i kille
and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the
dark

landlord for gods sake peter coffin shouted i landlord watch
coffin angels save me

speake tellee me whoee be or damme i kille again growled the
cannibal while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the
hot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen would get on fire
but thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room light
in hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him

dont be afraid now said he grinning again queequeg here wouldnt
harm a hair of your head

stop your grinning shouted i and why didnt you tell me that that
infernal harpooneer was a cannibal

i thought ye knowd itdidnt i tell ye he was a peddlin heads
around townbut turn flukes again and go to sleep queequeg look
hereyou sabbee me i sabbeeyou this man sleepe youyou sabbee

me sabbee plentygrunted queequeg puffing away at his pipe and
sitting up in bed

you gettee in he added motioning to me with his tomahawk and
throwing the clothes to one side he really did this in not only a civil
but a really kind and charitable way i stood looking at him a moment
for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean comely looking
cannibal whats all this fuss i have been making about thought i to
myselfthe mans a human being just as i am he has just as much reason
to fear me as i have to be afraid of him better sleep with a sober
cannibal than a drunken christian

landlord said i tell him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or
whatever you call it tell him to stop smoking in short and i will
turn in with him but i dont fancy having a man smoking in bed with me
its dangerous besides i aint insured

this being told to queequeg he at once complied and again politely
motioned me to get into bedrolling over to one side as much as to
sayi wont touch a leg of ye

good night landlord said i you may go

i turned in and never slept better in my life



chapter  the counterpane


upon waking next morning about daylight i found queequegs arm thrown
over me in the most loving and affectionate manner you had almost
thought i had been his wife the counterpane was of patchwork full of
odd little particoloured squares and triangles and this arm of his
tattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure
no two parts of which were of one precise shadeowing i suppose to
his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade his shirt
sleeves irregularly rolled up at various timesthis same arm of his i
say looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt
indeed partly lying on it as the arm did when i first awoke i could
hardly tell it from the quilt they so blended their hues together and
it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that i could tell that
queequeg was hugging me

my sensations were strange let me try to explain them when i was a
child i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me
whether it was a reality or a dream i never could entirely settle
the circumstance was this i had been cutting up some caper or otheri
think it was trying to crawl up the chimney as i had seen a little
sweep do a few days previous and my stepmother who somehow or other
was all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperlessmy
mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to
bed though it was only two oclock in the afternoon of the st june
the longest day in the year in our hemisphere i felt dreadfully but
there was no help for it so up stairs i went to my little room in the
third floor undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time
and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets

i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse
before i could hope for a resurrection sixteen hours in bed the
small of my back ached to think of it and it was so light too the
sun shining in at the window and a great rattling of coaches in the
streets and the sound of gay voices all over the house i felt worse
and worseat last i got up dressed and softly going down in my
stockinged feet sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself
at her feet beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good
slippering for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemning me to lie
abed such an unendurable length of time but she was the best and most
conscientious of stepmothers and back i had to go to my room for
several hours i lay there broad awake feeling a great deal worse than i
have ever done since even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes at
last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and slowly
waking from ithalf steeped in dreamsi opened my eyes and the before
sunlit room was now wrapped in outer darkness instantly i felt a shock
running through all my frame nothing was to be seen and nothing was
to be heard but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine my arm hung
over the counterpane and the nameless unimaginable silent form
or phantom to which the hand belonged seemed closely seated by my
bedside for what seemed ages piled on ages i lay there frozen with
the most awful fears not daring to drag away my hand yet ever thinking
that if i could but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would be
broken i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me
but waking in the morning i shudderingly remembered it all and for
days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself in confounding
attempts to explain the mystery nay to this very hour i often puzzle
myself with it

now take away the awful fear and my sensations at feeling the
supernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to
those which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequegs pagan
arm thrown round me but at length all the past nights events soberly
recurred one by one in fixed reality and then i lay only alive to
the comical predicament for though i tried to move his armunlock his
bridegroom claspyet sleeping as he was he still hugged me tightly
as though naught but death should part us twain i now strove to rouse
himqueequegbut his only answer was a snore i then rolled over
my neck feeling as if it were in a horsecollar and suddenly felt a
slight scratch throwing aside the counterpane there lay the tomahawk
sleeping by the savages side as if it were a hatchetfaced baby a
pretty pickle truly thought i abed here in a strange house in the
broad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk queequegin the name of
goodness queequeg wake at length by dint of much wriggling and
loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his
hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style i succeeded in
extracting a grunt and presently he drew back his arm shook himself
all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in bed
stiff as a pikestaff looking at me and rubbing his eyes as if he
did not altogether remember how i came to be there though a dim
consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over
him meanwhile i lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgivings
now and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature when at
last his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow
and he became as it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out upon
the floor and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that
if it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress
afterwards leaving the whole apartment to myself thinks i queequeg
under the circumstances this is a very civilized overture but the
truth is these savages have an innate sense of delicacy say what
you will it is marvellous how essentially polite they are i pay this
particular compliment to queequeg because he treated me with so much
civility and consideration while i was guilty of great rudeness
staring at him from the bed and watching all his toilette motions for
the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding nevertheless
a man like queequeg you dont see every day he and his ways were well
worth unusual regarding

he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tall one
by the by and thenstill minus his trowsershe hunted up his boots
what under the heavens he did it for i cannot tell but his next
movement was to crush himselfboots in hand and hat onunder the bed
when from sundry violent gaspings and strainings i inferred he was
hard at work booting himself though by no law of propriety that i ever
heard of is any man required to be private when putting on his
boots but queequeg do you see was a creature in the transition
stageneither caterpillar nor butterfly he was just enough civilized
to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners his
education was not yet completed he was an undergraduate if he had not
been a small degree civilized he very probably would not have troubled
himself with boots at all but then if he had not been still a savage
he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on at
last he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his
eyes and began creaking and limping about the room as if not
being much accustomed to boots his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide
onesprobably not made to order eitherrather pinched and tormented
him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning

seeing now that there were no curtains to the window and that the
street being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain view
into the room and observing more and more the indecorous figure that
queequeg made staving about with little else but his hat and boots on
i begged him as well as i could to accelerate his toilet somewhat
and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible he
complied and then proceeded to wash himself at that time in the
morning any christian would have washed his face but queequeg to
my amazement contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his
chest arms and hands he then donned his waistcoat and taking up a
piece of hard soap on the washstand centre table dipped it into water
and commenced lathering his face i was watching to see where he kept
his razor when lo and behold he takes the harpoon from the bed corner
slips out the long wooden stock unsheathes the head whets it a little
on his boot and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall
begins a vigorous scraping or rather harpooning of his cheeks thinks
i queequeg this is using rogerss best cutlery with a vengeance
afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of
what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp
the long straight edges are always kept

the rest of his toilet was soon achieved and he proudly marched out of
the room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket and sporting his
harpoon like a marshals baton



chapter  breakfast


i quickly followed suit and descending into the barroom accosted the
grinning landlord very pleasantly i cherished no malice towards him
though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my
bedfellow

however a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a
good thing the mores the pity so if any one man in his own
proper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not be
backward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in
that way and the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him
be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for

the barroom was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the
night previous and whom i had not as yet had a good look at they were
nearly all whalemen chief mates and second mates and third mates and
sea carpenters and sea coopers and sea blacksmiths and harpooneers
and ship keepers a brown and brawny company with bosky beards an
unshorn shaggy set all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns

you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore this
young fellows healthy cheek is like a suntoasted pear in hue and
would seem to smell almost as musky he cannot have been three days
landed from his indian voyage that man next him looks a few shades
lighter you might say a touch of satin wood is in him in the
complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightly bleached
withal he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore but who could show
a cheek like queequeg which barred with various tints seemed like the
andes western slope to show forth in one array contrasting climates
zone by zone

grub ho now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in we went
to breakfast

they say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at ease
in manner quite selfpossessed in company not always though ledyard
the great new england traveller and mungo park the scotch one of all
men they possessed the least assurance in the parlor but perhaps the
mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as ledyard did or
the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negro heart
of africa which was the sum of poor mungos performancesthis kind of
travel i say may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social
polish still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had
anywhere

these reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that
after we were all seated at the table and i was preparing to hear some
good stories about whaling to my no small surprise nearly every
man maintained a profound silence and not only that but they looked
embarrassed yes here were a set of seadogs many of whom without the
slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seasentire
strangers to themand duelled them dead without winking and yet here
they sat at a social breakfast tableall of the same calling all of
kindred tasteslooking round as sheepishly at each other as though they
had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains
a curious sight these bashful bears these timid warrior whalemen

but as for queequegwhy queequeg sat there among themat the head of
the table too it so chanced as cool as an icicle to be sure i cannot
say much for his breeding his greatest admirer could not have cordially
justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him and using it
there without ceremony reaching over the table with it to the imminent
jeopardy of many heads and grappling the beefsteaks towards him but
that was certainly very coolly done by him and every one knows that in
most peoples estimation to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly

we will not speak of all queequegs peculiarities here how he eschewed
coffee and hot rolls and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks
done rare enough that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the
rest into the public room lighted his tomahawkpipe and was sitting
there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when i
sallied out for a stroll



chapter  the street


if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish
an individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of a
civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first
daylight stroll through the streets of new bedford

in thoroughfares nigh the docks any considerable seaport will
frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign
parts even in broadway and chestnut streets mediterranean mariners
will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies regent street is not
unknown to lascars and malays and at bombay in the apollo green live
yankees have often scared the natives but new bedford beats all water
street and wapping in these lastmentioned haunts you see only sailors
but in new bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners
savages outright many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh it
makes a stranger stare

but besides the feegeeans tongatobooarrs erromanggoans pannangians
and brighggians and besides the wild specimens of the whalingcraft
which unheeded reel about the streets you will see other sights still
more curious certainly more comical there weekly arrive in this town
scores of green vermonters and new hampshire men all athirst for gain
and glory in the fishery they are mostly young of stalwart frames
fellows who have felled forests and now seek to drop the axe and snatch
the whalelance many are as green as the green mountains whence they
came in some things you would think them but a few hours old look
there that chap strutting round the corner he wears a beaver hat and
swallowtailed coat girdled with a sailorbelt and sheathknife here
comes another with a souwester and a bombazine cloak

no townbred dandy will compare with a countrybred onei mean a
downright bumpkin dandya fellow that in the dogdays will mow his
two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands now when a
country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished
reputation and joins the great whalefishery you should see the
comical things he does upon reaching the seaport in bespeaking his
seaoutfit he orders bellbuttons to his waistcoats straps to his
canvas trowsers ah poor hayseed how bitterly will burst those straps
in the first howling gale when thou art driven straps buttons and
all down the throat of the tempest

but think not that this famous town has only harpooneers cannibals and
bumpkins to show her visitors not at all still new bedford is a queer
place had it not been for us whalemen that tract of land would this
day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of labrador
as it is parts of her back country are enough to frighten one they
look so bony the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live
in in all new england it is a land of oil true enough but not like
canaan a land also of corn and wine the streets do not run with
milk nor in the springtime do they pave them with fresh eggs yet in
spite of this nowhere in all america will you find more patricianlike
houses parks and gardens more opulent than in new bedford whence came
they how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country

go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
mansion and your question will be answered yes all these brave houses
and flowery gardens came from the atlantic pacific and indian oceans
one and all they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom
of the sea can herr alexander perform a feat like that

in new bedford fathers they say give whales for dowers to their
daughters and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises apiece
you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding for they say
they have reservoirs of oil in every house and every night recklessly
burn their lengths in spermaceti candles

in summer time the town is sweet to see full of fine mapleslong
avenues of green and gold and in august high in air the beautiful and
bountiful horsechestnuts candelabrawise proffer the passerby their
tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms so omnipotent is art
which in many a district of new bedford has superinduced bright terraces
of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creations final
day

and the women of new bedford they bloom like their own red roses but
roses only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks
is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens elsewhere match that
bloom of theirs ye cannot save in salem where they tell me the young
girls breathe such musk their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off
shore as though they were drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of
the puritanic sands



chapter  the chapel


in this same new bedford there stands a whalemans chapel and few are
the moody fishermen shortly bound for the indian ocean or pacific who
fail to make a sunday visit to the spot i am sure that i did not

returning from my first morning stroll i again sallied out upon this
special errand the sky had changed from clear sunny cold to driving
sleet and mist wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called
bearskin i fought my way against the stubborn storm entering i
found a small scattered congregation of sailors and sailors wives and
widows a muffled silence reigned only broken at times by the shrieks
of the storm each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from
the other as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable the
chaplain had not yet arrived and there these silent islands of men and
women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets with black borders
masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit three of them ran
something like the following but i do not pretend to quote

sacred to the memory of john talbot who at the age of eighteen was
lost overboard near the isle of desolation off patagonia november
st  this tablet is erected to his memory by his sister

sacred to the memory of robert long willis ellery nathan coleman
walter canny seth macy and samuel gleig forming one of the boats
crews of the ship eliza who were towed out of sight by a whale on the
offshore ground in the pacific december st  this marble is
here placed by their surviving shipmates

sacred to the memory of the late captain ezekiel hardy who in the bows
of his boat was killed by a sperm whale on the coast of japan august
d  this tablet is erected to his memory by his widow

shaking off the sleet from my iceglazed hat and jacket i seated myself
near the door and turning sideways was surprised to see queequeg near
me affected by the solemnity of the scene there was a wondering gaze
of incredulous curiosity in his countenance this savage was the only
person present who seemed to notice my entrance because he was the only
one who could not read and therefore was not reading those frigid
inscriptions on the wall whether any of the relatives of the seamen
whose names appeared there were now among the congregation i knew not
but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery and so plainly
did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings
of some unceasing grief that i feel sure that here before me were
assembled those in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak
tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh

oh ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass who standing among
flowers can sayhere here lies my beloved ye know not the desolation
that broods in bosoms like these what bitter blanks in those
blackbordered marbles which cover no ashes what despair in those
immovable inscriptions what deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in
the lines that seem to gnaw upon all faith and refuse resurrections to
the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave as well might
those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta as here

in what census of living creatures the dead of mankind are included
why it is that a universal proverb says of them that they tell no
tales though containing more secrets than the goodwin sands how it is
that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world we prefix
so significant and infidel a word and yet do not thus entitle him if
he but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth why the
life insurance companies pay deathforfeitures upon immortals in what
eternal unstirring paralysis and deadly hopeless trance yet lies
antique adam who died sixty round centuries ago how it is that we
still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are
dwelling in unspeakable bliss why all the living so strive to hush all
the dead wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a
whole city all these things are not without their meanings

but faith like a jackal feeds among the tombs and even from these
dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope

it needs scarcely to be told with what feelings on the eve of a
nantucket voyage i regarded those marble tablets and by the murky
light of that darkened doleful day read the fate of the whalemen
who had gone before me yes ishmael the same fate may be thine but
somehow i grew merry again delightful inducements to embark fine
chance for promotion it seemsaye a stove boat will make me an
immortal by brevet yes there is death in this business of whalinga
speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity but what
then methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death
methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true
substance methinks that in looking at things spiritual we are too
much like oysters observing the sun through the water and thinking that
thick water the thinnest of air methinks my body is but the lees of my
better being in fact take my body who will take it i say it is not
me and therefore three cheers for nantucket and come a stove boat and
stove body when they will for stave my soul jove himself cannot



chapter  the pulpit


i had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
robustness entered immediately as the stormpelted door flew back upon
admitting him a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation
sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain yes it
was the famous father mapple so called by the whalemen among whom he
was a very great favourite he had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his
youth but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry
at the time i now write of father mapple was in the hardy winter of a
healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merging into a second
flowering youth for among all the fissures of his wrinkles there shone
certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloomthe spring verdure
peeping forth even beneath februarys snow no one having previously
heard his history could for the first time behold father mapple without
the utmost interest because there were certain engrafted clerical
peculiarities about him imputable to that adventurous maritime life
he had led when he entered i observed that he carried no umbrella and
certainly had not come in his carriage for his tarpaulin hat ran down
with melting sleet and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to
drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed
however hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed and hung up
in a little space in an adjacent corner when arrayed in a decent suit
he quietly approached the pulpit

like most old fashioned pulpits it was a very lofty one and since a
regular stairs to such a height would by its long angle with the floor
seriously contract the already small area of the chapel the architect
it seemed had acted upon the hint of father mapple and finished the
pulpit without a stairs substituting a perpendicular side ladder like
those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea the wife of a whaling
captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted
manropes for this ladder which being itself nicely headed and
stained with a mahogany colour the whole contrivance considering what
manner of chapel it was seemed by no means in bad taste halting for
an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both hands grasping the
ornamental knobs of the manropes father mapple cast a look upwards
and then with a truly sailorlike but still reverential dexterity hand
over hand mounted the steps as if ascending the maintop of his vessel

the perpendicular parts of this side ladder as is usually the case with
swinging ones were of clothcovered rope only the rounds were of wood
so that at every step there was a joint at my first glimpse of the
pulpit it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship
these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary for i was not
prepared to see father mapple after gaining the height slowly turn
round and stooping over the pulpit deliberately drag up the ladder
step by step till the whole was deposited within leaving him
impregnable in his little quebec

i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this
father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity
that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks
of the stage no thought i there must be some sober reason for this
thing furthermore it must symbolize something unseen can it be
then that by that act of physical isolation he signifies his spiritual
withdrawal for the time from all outward worldly ties and connexions
yes for replenished with the meat and wine of the word to the faithful
man of god this pulpit i see is a selfcontaining strongholda lofty
ehrenbreitstein with a perennial well of water within the walls

but the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place
borrowed from the chaplains former seafarings between the marble
cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed its back
was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating
against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy
breakers but high above the flying scud and darkrolling clouds there
floated a little isle of sunlight from which beamed forth an angels
face and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the
ships tossed deck something like that silver plate now inserted into
the victorys plank where nelson fell ah noble ship the angel
seemed to say beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardy
helm for lo the sun is breaking through the clouds are rolling
offserenest azure is at hand

nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same seataste that
had achieved the ladder and the picture its panelled front was in
the likeness of a ships bluff bows and the holy bible rested on a
projecting piece of scroll work fashioned after a ships fiddleheaded
beak

what could be more full of meaningfor the pulpit is ever this earths
foremost part all the rest comes in its rear the pulpit leads the
world from thence it is the storm of gods quick wrath is first
descried and the bow must bear the earliest brunt from thence it is
the god of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds
yes the worlds a ship on its passage out and not a voyage complete
and the pulpit is its prow



chapter  the sermon


father mapple rose and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered
the scattered people to condense starboard gangway there side away
to larboardlarboard gangway to starboard midships midships

there was a low rumbling of heavy seaboots among the benches and a
still slighter shuffling of womens shoes and all was quiet again and
every eye on the preacher

he paused a little then kneeling in the pulpits bows folded his large
brown hands across his chest uplifted his closed eyes and offered
a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the
bottom of the sea

this ended in prolonged solemn tones like the continual tolling of
a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fogin such tones he
commenced reading the following hymn but changing his manner towards
the concluding stanzas burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy

     the ribs and terrors in the whale
     arched over me a dismal gloom
     while all gods sunlit waves rolled by
     and lift me deepening down to doom

     i saw the opening maw of hell
     with endless pains and sorrows there
     which none but they that feel can tell
     oh i was plunging to despair

     in black distress i called my god
     when i could scarce believe him mine
     he bowed his ear to my complaints
     no more the whale did me confine

     with speed he flew to my relief
     as on a radiant dolphin borne
     awful yet bright as lightning shone
     the face of my deliverer god

     my song for ever shall record
     that terrible that joyful hour
     i give the glory to my god
     his all the mercy and the power


nearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above the
howling of the storm a brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turned
over the leaves of the bible and at last folding his hand down upon
the proper page said beloved shipmates clinch the last verse of the
first chapter of jonahand god had prepared a great fish to swallow up
jonah

shipmates this book containing only four chaptersfour yarnsis one
of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures yet what
depths of the soul does jonahs deep sealine sound what a pregnant
lesson to us is this prophet what a noble thing is that canticle in the
fishs belly how billowlike and boisterously grand we feel the floods
surging over us we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters
seaweed and all the slime of the sea is about us but what is this
lesson that the book of jonah teaches shipmates it is a twostranded
lesson a lesson to us all as sinful men and a lesson to me as a pilot
of the living god as sinful men it is a lesson to us all because it
is a story of the sin hardheartedness suddenly awakened fears the
swift punishment repentance prayers and finally the deliverance and
joy of jonah as with all sinners among men the sin of this son of
amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of godnever
mind now what that command was or how conveyedwhich he found a hard
command but all the things that god would have us do are hard for us to
doremember thatand hence he oftener commands us than endeavors to
persuade and if we obey god we must disobey ourselves and it is in
this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obeying god consists

with this sin of disobedience in him jonah still further flouts at
god by seeking to flee from him he thinks that a ship made by men will
carry him into countries where god does not reign but only the captains
of this earth he skulks about the wharves of joppa and seeks a ship
thats bound for tarshish there lurks perhaps a hitherto unheeded
meaning here by all accounts tarshish could have been no other city
than the modern cadiz thats the opinion of learned men and where is
cadiz shipmates cadiz is in spain as far by water from joppa
as jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days when the
atlantic was an almost unknown sea because joppa the modern jaffa
shipmates is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean the
syrian and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand miles to the
westward from that just outside the straits of gibraltar see ye
not then shipmates that jonah sought to flee worldwide from god
miserable man oh most contemptible and worthy of all scorn with
slouched hat and guilty eye skulking from his god prowling among the
shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas so disordered
selfcondemning is his look that had there been policemen in those
days jonah on the mere suspicion of something wrong had been arrested
ere he touched a deck how plainly hes a fugitive no baggage not a
hatbox valise or carpetbagno friends accompany him to the wharf
with their adieux at last after much dodging search he finds the
tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo and as he steps on
board to see its captain in the cabin all the sailors for the moment
desist from hoisting in the goods to mark the strangers evil eye
jonah sees this but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence
in vain essays his wretched smile strong intuitions of the man assure
the mariners he can be no innocent in their gamesome but still serious
way one whispers to the otherjack hes robbed a widow or joe
do you mark him hes a bigamist or harry lad i guess hes the
adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah or belike one of the missing
murderers from sodom another runs to read the bill thats stuck
against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored offering
five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide and
containing a description of his person he reads and looks from jonah
to the bill while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round jonah
prepared to lay their hands upon him frighted jonah trembles and
summoning all his boldness to his face only looks so much the more a
coward he will not confess himself suspected but that itself is strong
suspicion so he makes the best of it and when the sailors find him
not to be the man that is advertised they let him pass and he descends
into the cabin

whos there cries the captain at his busy desk hurriedly making
out his papers for the customswhos there oh how that harmless
question mangles jonah for the instant he almost turns to flee again
but he rallies i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon
sail ye sir thus far the busy captain had not looked up to jonah
though the man now stands before him but no sooner does he hear that
hollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing glance we sail with the
next coming tide at last he slowly answered still intently eyeing
him no sooner sirsoon enough for any honest man that goes a
passenger ha jonah thats another stab but he swiftly calls away
the captain from that scent ill sail with yehe saysthe
passage money how much is thatill pay now for it is particularly
written shipmates as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this
history that he paid the fare thereof ere the craft did sail and
taken with the context this is full of meaning

now jonahs captain shipmates was one whose discernment detects crime
in any but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless in this
world shipmates sin that pays its way can travel freely and without
a passport whereas virtue if a pauper is stopped at all frontiers
so jonahs captain prepares to test the length of jonahs purse ere he
judge him openly he charges him thrice the usual sum and its assented
to then the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive but at the same
time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold yet when
jonah fairly takes out his purse prudent suspicions still molest the
captain he rings every coin to find a counterfeit not a forger any
way he mutters and jonah is put down for his passage point out my
stateroom sir says jonah now im travelweary i need sleep
thou lookest like it says the captain theres thy room jonah
enters and would lock the door but the lock contains no key hearing
him foolishly fumbling there the captain laughs lowly to himself and
mutters something about the doors of convicts cells being never allowed
to be locked within all dressed and dusty as he is jonah throws
himself into his berth and finds the little stateroom ceiling almost
resting on his forehead the air is close and jonah gasps then in
that contracted hole sunk too beneath the ships waterline jonah
feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour when the whale
shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels wards

screwed at its axis against the side a swinging lamp slightly
oscillates in jonahs room and the ship heeling over towards the wharf
with the weight of the last bales received the lamp flame and all
though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquity with
reference to the room though in truth infallibly straight itself it
but made obvious the false lying levels among which it hung the lamp
alarms and frightens jonah as lying in his berth his tormented eyes
roll round the place and this thus far successful fugitive finds no
refuge for his restless glance but that contradiction in the lamp more
and more appals him the floor the ceiling and the side are all awry
oh so my conscience hangs in me he groans straight upwards so it
burns but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness

like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed still
reeling but with conscience yet pricking him as the plungings of the
roman racehorse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him as
one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish
praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed and at last amid
the whirl of woe he feels a deep stupor steals over him as over the
man who bleeds to death for conscience is the wound and theres naught
to staunch it so after sore wrestlings in his berth jonahs prodigy
of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep

and now the time of tide has come the ship casts off her cables and
from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish all careening
glides to sea that ship my friends was the first of recorded
smugglers the contraband was jonah but the sea rebels he will not
bear the wicked burden a dreadful storm comes on the ship is like to
break but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her
when boxes bales and jars are clattering overboard when the wind
is shrieking and the men are yelling and every plank thunders with
trampling feet right over jonahs head in all this raging tumult jonah
sleeps his hideous sleep he sees no black sky and raging sea feels not
the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the
mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after
him aye shipmates jonah was gone down into the sides of the shipa
berth in the cabin as i have taken it and was fast asleep but the
frightened master comes to him and shrieks in his dead ear what
meanest thou o sleeper arise startled from his lethargy by that
direful cry jonah staggers to his feet and stumbling to the deck
grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea but at that moment he is
sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks wave after
wave thus leaps into the ship and finding no speedy vent runs roaring
fore and aft till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat
and ever as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep
gullies in the blackness overhead aghast jonah sees the rearing
bowsprit pointing high upward but soon beat downward again towards the
tormented deep

terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul in all his cringing
attitudes the godfugitive is now too plainly known the sailors mark
him more and more certain grow their suspicions of him and at last
fully to test the truth by referring the whole matter to high heaven
they fall to casting lots to see for whose cause this great tempest was
upon them the lot is jonahs that discovered then how furiously they
mob him with their questions what is thine occupation whence comest
thou thy country what people but mark now my shipmates the behavior
of poor jonah the eager mariners but ask him who he is and where
from whereas they not only receive an answer to those questions
but likewise another answer to a question not put by them but the
unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hard hand of god that is
upon him

i am a hebrew he criesand theni fear the lord the god of heaven
who hath made the sea and the dry land fear him o jonah aye well
mightest thou fear the lord god then straightway he now goes on to
make a full confession whereupon the mariners became more and more
appalled but still are pitiful for when jonah not yet supplicating
god for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of his
desertswhen wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him
forth into the sea for he knew that for his sake this great tempest
was upon them they mercifully turn from him and seek by other means to
save the ship but all in vain the indignant gale howls louder
then with one hand raised invokingly to god with the other they not
unreluctantly lay hold of jonah

and now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea
when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east and the sea
is still as jonah carries down the gale with him leaving smooth
water behind he goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless
commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into
the yawning jaws awaiting him and the whale shootsto all his ivory
teeth like so many white bolts upon his prison then jonah prayed unto
the lord out of the fishs belly but observe his prayer and learn a
weighty lesson for sinful as he is jonah does not weep and wail for
direct deliverance he feels that his dreadful punishment is just he
leaves all his deliverance to god contenting himself with this that
spite of all his pains and pangs he will still look towards his holy
temple and here shipmates is true and faithful repentance not
clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment and how pleasing to
god was this conduct in jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance of
him from the sea and the whale shipmates i do not place jonah before
you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as a model
for repentance sin not but if you do take heed to repent of it like
jonah

while he was speaking these words the howling of the shrieking
slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher who
when describing jonahs seastorm seemed tossed by a storm himself
his deep chest heaved as with a groundswell his tossed arms seemed the
warring elements at work and the thunders that rolled away from off his
swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his simple
hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them

there now came a lull in his look as he silently turned over the leaves
of the book once more and at last standing motionless with closed
eyes for the moment seemed communing with god and himself

but again he leaned over towards the people and bowing his head lowly
with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility he spake these
words

shipmates god has laid but one hand upon you both his hands press
upon me i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that
jonah teaches to all sinners and therefore to ye and still more to me
for i am a greater sinner than ye and now how gladly would i come down
from this masthead and sit on the hatches there where you sit and
listen as you listen while some one of you reads me that other and more
awful lesson which jonah teaches to me as a pilot of the living god
how being an anointed pilotprophet or speaker of true things and
bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a
wicked nineveh jonah appalled at the hostility he should raise fled
from his mission and sought to escape his duty and his god by taking
ship at joppa but god is everywhere tarshish he never reached as we
have seen god came upon him in the whale and swallowed him down to
living gulfs of doom and with swift slantings tore him along into the
midst of the seas where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand
fathoms down and the weeds were wrapped about his head and all the
watery world of woe bowled over him yet even then beyond the reach of
any plummetout of the belly of hellwhen the whale grounded upon
the oceans utmost bones even then god heard the engulphed repenting
prophet when he cried then god spake unto the fish and from the
shuddering cold and blackness of the sea the whale came breeching
up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all the delights of air and
earth and vomited out jonah upon the dry land when the word of the
lord came a second time and jonah bruised and beatenhis ears like
two seashells still multitudinously murmuring of the oceanjonah
did the almightys bidding and what was that shipmates to preach the
truth to the face of falsehood that was it

this shipmates this is that other lesson and woe to that pilot of
the living god who slights it woe to him whom this world charms from
gospel duty woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when god
has brewed them into a gale woe to him who seeks to please rather than
to appal woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness woe
to him who in this world courts not dishonour woe to him who would
not be true even though to be false were salvation yea woe to him
who as the great pilot paul has it while preaching to others is
himself a castaway

he dropped and fell away from himself for a moment then lifting his
face to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried out with
a heavenly enthusiasmbut oh shipmates on the starboard hand of
every woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight
than the bottom of the woe is deep is not the maintruck higher than
the kelson is low delight is to hima far far upward and inward
delightwho against the proud gods and commodores of this earth ever
stands forth his own inexorable self delight is to him whose strong
arms yet support him when the ship of this base treacherous world has
gone down beneath him delight is to him who gives no quarter in the
truth and kills burns and destroys all sin though he pluck it out
from under the robes of senators and judges delighttopgallant
delight is to him who acknowledges no law or lord but the lord his
god and is only a patriot to heaven delight is to him whom all the
waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake
from this sure keel of the ages and eternal delight and deliciousness
will be his who coming to lay him down can say with his final
breatho fatherchiefly known to me by thy rodmortal or immortal
here i die i have striven to be thine more than to be this worlds or
mine own yet this is nothing i leave eternity to thee for what is man
that he should live out the lifetime of his god

he said no more but slowly waving a benediction covered his face with
his hands and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed
and he was left alone in the place



chapter  a bosom friend


returning to the spouterinn from the chapel i found queequeg there
quite alone he having left the chapel before the benediction some time
he was sitting on a bench before the fire with his feet on the stove
hearth and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little
negro idol of his peering hard into its face and with a jackknife
gently whittling away at its nose meanwhile humming to himself in his
heathenish way

but being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon going
to the table took up a large book there and placing it on his lap
began counting the pages with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth
pageas i fanciedstopping a moment looking vacantly around him and
giving utterance to a longdrawn gurgling whistle of astonishment he
would then begin again at the next fifty seeming to commence at number
one each time as though he could not count more than fifty and it was
only by such a large number of fifties being found together that his
astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited

with much interest i sat watching him savage though he was and
hideously marred about the faceat least to my tastehis countenance
yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable you cannot
hide the soul through all his unearthly tattooings i thought i saw
the traces of a simple honest heart and in his large deep eyes
fiery black and bold there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a
thousand devils and besides all this there was a certain lofty bearing
about the pagan which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim
he looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor
whether it was too that his head being shaved his forehead was drawn
out in freer and brighter relief and looked more expansive than it
otherwise would this i will not venture to decide but certain it was
his head was phrenologically an excellent one it may seem ridiculous
but it reminded me of general washingtons head as seen in the popular
busts of him it had the same long regularly graded retreating slope
from above the brows which were likewise very projecting like two
long promontories thickly wooded on top queequeg was george washington
cannibalistically developed

whilst i was thus closely scanning him halfpretending meanwhile to be
looking out at the storm from the casement he never heeded my presence
never troubled himself with so much as a single glance but appeared
wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book
considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night
previous and especially considering the affectionate arm i had found
thrown over me upon waking in the morning i thought this indifference
of his very strange but savages are strange beings at times you do not
know exactly how to take them at first they are overawing their calm
selfcollectedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom i had noticed
also that queequeg never consorted at all or but very little with the
other seamen in the inn he made no advances whatever appeared to have
no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances all this struck
me as mighty singular yet upon second thoughts there was something
almost sublime in it here was a man some twenty thousand miles from
home by the way of cape horn that iswhich was the only way he could
get therethrown among people as strange to him as though he were in
the planet jupiter and yet he seemed entirely at his ease preserving
the utmost serenity content with his own companionship always equal to
himself surely this was a touch of fine philosophy though no doubt he
had never heard there was such a thing as that but perhaps to be
true philosophers we mortals should not be conscious of so living or
so striving so soon as i hear that such or such a man gives himself
out for a philosopher i conclude that like the dyspeptic old woman he
must have broken his digester

as i sat there in that now lonely room the fire burning low in that
mild stage when after its first intensity has warmed the air it then
only glows to be looked at the evening shades and phantoms gathering
round the casements and peering in upon us silent solitary twain
the storm booming without in solemn swells i began to be sensible of
strange feelings i felt a melting in me no more my splintered heart
and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world this soothing
savage had redeemed it there he sat his very indifference speaking a
nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits
wild he was a very sight of sights to see yet i began to feel myself
mysteriously drawn towards him and those same things that would have
repelled most others they were the very magnets that thus drew me ill
try a pagan friend thought i since christian kindness has proved but
hollow courtesy i drew my bench near him and made some friendly signs
and hints doing my best to talk with him meanwhile at first he little
noticed these advances but presently upon my referring to his last
nights hospitalities he made out to ask me whether we were again to be
bedfellows i told him yes whereat i thought he looked pleased perhaps
a little complimented

we then turned over the book together and i endeavored to explain to
him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few pictures
that were in it thus i soon engaged his interest and from that we went
to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen
in this famous town soon i proposed a social smoke and producing
his pouch and tomahawk he quietly offered me a puff and then we sat
exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his and keeping it regularly
passing between us

if there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the pagans
breast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out and left
us cronies he seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as
i to him and when our smoke was over he pressed his forehead against
mine clasped me round the waist and said that henceforth we were
married meaning in his countrys phrase that we were bosom friends
he would gladly die for me if need should be in a countryman this
sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature a thing
to be much distrusted but in this simple savage those old rules would
not apply

after supper and another social chat and smoke we went to our room
together he made me a present of his embalmed head took out his
enormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out
some thirty dollars in silver then spreading them on the table and
mechanically dividing them into two equal portions pushed one of them
towards me and said it was mine i was going to remonstrate but he
silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers pockets i let them stay
he then went about his evening prayers took out his idol and removed
the paper fireboard by certain signs and symptoms i thought he seemed
anxious for me to join him but well knowing what was to follow i
deliberated a moment whether in case he invited me i would comply or
otherwise

i was a good christian born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
presbyterian church how then could i unite with this wild idolator in
worshipping his piece of wood but what is worship thought i do
you suppose now ishmael that the magnanimous god of heaven and
earthpagans and all includedcan possibly be jealous of an
insignificant bit of black wood impossible but what is worshipto do
the will of godthat is worship and what is the will of godto do to
my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to methat is the
will of god now queequeg is my fellow man and what do i wish that
this queequeg would do to me why unite with me in my particular
presbyterian form of worship consequently i must then unite with him
in his ergo i must turn idolator so i kindled the shavings helped
prop up the innocent little idol offered him burnt biscuit with
queequeg salamed before him twice or thrice kissed his nose and that
done we undressed and went to bed at peace with our own consciences
and all the world but we did not go to sleep without some little chat

how it is i know not but there is no place like a bed for confidential
disclosures between friends man and wife they say there open the very
bottom of their souls to each other and some old couples often lie
and chat over old times till nearly morning thus then in our hearts
honeymoon lay i and queequega cosy loving pair



chapter  nightgown


we had lain thus in bed chatting and napping at short intervals and
queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs
over mine and then drawing them back so entirely sociable and free
and easy were we when at last by reason of our confabulations what
little nappishness remained in us altogether departed and we felt like
getting up again though daybreak was yet some way down the future

yes we became very wakeful so much so that our recumbent position
began to grow wearisome and by little and little we found ourselves
sitting up the clothes well tucked around us leaning against the
headboard with our four knees drawn up close together and our two
noses bending over them as if our kneepans were warmingpans we felt
very nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out of doors
indeed out of bedclothes too seeing that there was no fire in the
room the more so i say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some
small part of you must be cold for there is no quality in this world
that is not what it is merely by contrast nothing exists in itself if
you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable and have been so
a long time then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more but if
like queequeg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crown
of your head be slightly chilled why then indeed in the general
consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm for this
reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire which
is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich for the height of this
sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and
your snugness and the cold of the outer air then there you lie like the
one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal

we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time when all at
once i thought i would open my eyes for when between sheets whether
by day or by night and whether asleep or awake i have a way of always
keeping my eyes shut in order the more to concentrate the snugness
of being in bed because no man can ever feel his own identity aright
except his eyes be closed as if darkness were indeed the proper element
of our essences though light be more congenial to our clayey part upon
opening my eyes then and coming out of my own pleasant and selfcreated
darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated
twelveoclockatnight i experienced a disagreeable revulsion nor did
i at all object to the hint from queequeg that perhaps it were best to
strike a light seeing that we were so wide awake and besides he felt
a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his tomahawk be it said
that though i had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the
bed the night before yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when
love once comes to bend them for now i liked nothing better than to
have queequeg smoking by me even in bed because he seemed to be full
of such serene household joy then i no more felt unduly concerned for
the landlords policy of insurance i was only alive to the condensed
confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real
friend with our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders we now passed
the tomahawk from one to the other till slowly there grew over us a
blue hanging tester of smoke illuminated by the flame of the newlit
lamp

whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far
distant scenes i know not but he now spoke of his native island and
eager to hear his history i begged him to go on and tell it he gladly
complied though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few of his
words yet subsequent disclosures when i had become more familiar with
his broken phraseology now enable me to present the whole story such as
it may prove in the mere skeleton i give



chapter  biographical


queequeg was a native of rokovoko an island far away to the west and
south it is not down in any map true places never are

when a newhatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in
a grass clout followed by the nibbling goats as if he were a green
sapling even then in queequegs ambitious soul lurked a strong desire
to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two his
father was a high chief a king his uncle a high priest and on the
maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable
warriors there was excellent blood in his veinsroyal stuff though
sadly vitiated i fear by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his
untutored youth

a sag harbor ship visited his fathers bay and queequeg sought a
passage to christian lands but the ship having her full complement of
seamen spurned his suit and not all the king his fathers influence
could prevail but queequeg vowed a vow alone in his canoe he paddled
off to a distant strait which he knew the ship must pass through when
she quitted the island on one side was a coral reef on the other a low
tongue of land covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the
water hiding his canoe still afloat among these thickets with its
prow seaward he sat down in the stern paddle low in hand and when the
ship was gliding by like a flash he darted out gained her side with
one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe climbed up
the chains and throwing himself at full length upon the deck grappled
a ringbolt there and swore not to let it go though hacked in pieces

in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard suspended a
cutlass over his naked wrists queequeg was the son of a king and
queequeg budged not struck by his desperate dauntlessness and his wild
desire to visit christendom the captain at last relented and told
him he might make himself at home but this fine young savagethis sea
prince of wales never saw the captains cabin they put him down among
the sailors and made a whaleman of him but like czar peter content to
toil in the shipyards of foreign cities queequeg disdained no seeming
ignominy if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his
untutored countrymen for at bottomso he told mehe was actuated by a
profound desire to learn among the christians the arts whereby to
make his people still happier than they were and more than that
still better than they were but alas the practices of whalemen soon
convinced him that even christians could be both miserable and wicked
infinitely more so than all his fathers heathens arrived at last in
old sag harbor and seeing what the sailors did there and then going on
to nantucket and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also
poor queequeg gave it up for lost thought he its a wicked world in
all meridians ill die a pagan

and thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among these christians
wore their clothes and tried to talk their gibberish hence the queer
ways about him though now some time from home

by hints i asked him whether he did not propose going back and having
a coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone he
being very old and feeble at the last accounts he answered no not yet
and added that he was fearful christianity or rather christians had
unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan
kings before him but by and by he said he would returnas soon as
he felt himself baptized again for the nonce however he proposed to
sail about and sow his wild oats in all four oceans they had made a
harpooneer of him and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now

i asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching his future
movements he answered to go to sea again in his old vocation upon
this i told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of my
intention to sail out of nantucket as being the most promising port for
an adventurous whaleman to embark from he at once resolved to accompany
me to that island ship aboard the same vessel get into the same watch
the same boat the same mess with me in short to share my every hap
with both my hands in his boldly dip into the potluck of both worlds
to all this i joyously assented for besides the affection i now felt
for queequeg he was an experienced harpooneer and as such could not
fail to be of great usefulness to one who like me was wholly ignorant
of the mysteries of whaling though well acquainted with the sea as
known to merchant seamen

his story being ended with his pipes last dying puff queequeg embraced
me pressed his forehead against mine and blowing out the light we
rolled over from each other this way and that and very soon were
sleeping


chapter  wheelbarrow


next morning monday after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber
for a block i settled my own and comrades bill using however my
comrades money the grinning landlord as well as the boarders seemed
amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between
me and queequegespecially as peter coffins cock and bull stories
about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person
whom i now companied with

we borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our things including my own
poor carpetbag and queequegs canvas sack and hammock away we went
down to the moss the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the
wharf as we were going along the people stared not at queequeg
so muchfor they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their
streetsbut at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms but we
heeded them not going along wheeling the barrow by turns and queequeg
now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs i asked
him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore and
whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons to this in
substance he replied that though what i hinted was true enough yet
he had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it was of
assured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate
with the hearts of whales in short like many inland reapers
and mowers who go into the farmers meadows armed with their own
scythesthough in no wise obliged to furnish themeven so queequeg
for his own private reasons preferred his own harpoon

shifting the barrow from my hand to his he told me a funny story about
the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen it was in sag harbor the owners
of his ship it seems had lent him one in which to carry his
heavy chest to his boarding house not to seem ignorant about the
thingthough in truth he was entirely so concerning the precise way in
which to manage the barrowqueequeg puts his chest upon it lashes it
fast and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf why
said i queequeg you might have known better than that one would
think didnt the people laugh

upon this he told me another story the people of his island of
rokovoko it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water
of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and
this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided
mat where the feast is held now a certain grand merchant ship once
touched at rokovoko and its commanderfrom all accounts a very
stately punctilious gentleman at least for a sea captainthis
commander was invited to the wedding feast of queequegs sister a
pretty young princess just turned of ten well when all the wedding
guests were assembled at the brides bamboo cottage this captain
marches in and being assigned the post of honour placed himself over
against the punchbowl and between the high priest and his majesty the
king queequegs father grace being saidfor those people have their
grace as well as wethough queequeg told me that unlike us who at such
times look downwards to our platters they on the contrary copying the
ducks glance upwards to the great giver of all feastsgrace i say
being said the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony
of the island that is dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers
into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates seeing himself
placed next the priest and noting the ceremony and thinking
himselfbeing captain of a shipas having plain precedence over a
mere island king especially in the kings own housethe captain coolly
proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowltaking it i suppose for a
huge fingerglass now said queequeg what you tink nowdidnt our
people laugh

at last passage paid and luggage safe we stood on board the schooner
hoisting sail it glided down the acushnet river on one side new
bedford rose in terraces of streets their icecovered trees all
glittering in the clear cold air huge hills and mountains of casks on
casks were piled upon her wharves and side by side the worldwandering
whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last while from others
came a sound of carpenters and coopers with blended noises of fires and
forges to melt the pitch all betokening that new cruises were on the
start that one most perilous and long voyage ended only begins a
second and a second ended only begins a third and so on for ever
and for aye such is the endlessness yea the intolerableness of all
earthly effort

gaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh the little
moss tossed the quick foam from her bows as a young colt his snortings
how i snuffed that tartar airhow i spurned that turnpike earththat
common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and
hoofs and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will
permit no records

at the same foamfountain queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me
his dusky nostrils swelled apart he showed his filed and pointed teeth
on on we flew and our offing gained the moss did homage to the
blast ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan sideways
leaning we sideways darted every ropeyarn tingling like a wire the
two tall masts buckling like indian canes in land tornadoes so full of
this reeling scene were we as we stood by the plunging bowsprit that
for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers a
lubberlike assembly who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so
companionable as though a white man were anything more dignified than a
whitewashed negro but there were some boobies and bumpkins there who
by their intense greenness must have come from the heart and centre of
all verdure queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him
behind his back i thought the bumpkins hour of doom was come dropping
his harpoon the brawny savage caught him in his arms and by an almost
miraculous dexterity and strength sent him high up bodily into the air
then slightly tapping his stern in midsomerset the fellow landed with
bursting lungs upon his feet while queequeg turning his back upon him
lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff

capting capting yelled the bumpkin running towards that officer
capting capting heres the devil

hallo you sir cried the captain a gaunt rib of the sea stalking
up to queequeg what in thunder do you mean by that dont you know you
might have killed that chap

what him say said queequeg as he mildly turned to me

he say said i that you came near kille that man there pointing
to the still shivering greenhorn

kille cried queequeg twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly
expression of disdain ah him bevy smalle fishe queequeg no kille
so smalle fishe queequeg kille big whale

look you roared the captain ill kille you you cannibal if you
try any more of your tricks aboard here so mind your eye

but it so happened just then that it was high time for the captain to
mind his own eye the prodigious strain upon the mainsail had parted
the weathersheet and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to
side completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck the poor
fellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly was swept overboard all
hands were in a panic and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it
seemed madness it flew from right to left and back again almost
in one ticking of a watch and every instant seemed on the point of
snapping into splinters nothing was done and nothing seemed capable of
being done those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eyeing the
boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale in the
midst of this consternation queequeg dropped deftly to his knees and
crawling under the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope secured one
end to the bulwarks and then flinging the other like a lasso caught it
round the boom as it swept over his head and at the next jerk the spar
was that way trapped and all was safe the schooner was run into the
wind and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat queequeg
stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long living arc of
a leap for three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog
throwing his long arms straight out before him and by turns revealing
his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam i looked at the grand
and glorious fellow but saw no one to be saved the greenhorn had gone
down shooting himself perpendicularly from the water queequeg now
took an instants glance around him and seeming to see just how matters
were dived down and disappeared a few minutes more and he rose again
one arm still striking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form
the boat soon picked them up the poor bumpkin was restored all hands
voted queequeg a noble trump the captain begged his pardon from that
hour i clove to queequeg like a barnacle yea till poor queequeg took
his last long dive

was there ever such unconsciousness he did not seem to think that he at
all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies he only
asked for waterfresh watersomething to wipe the brine off that
done he put on dry clothes lighted his pipe and leaning against the
bulwarks and mildly eyeing those around him seemed to be saying
to himselfits a mutual jointstock world in all meridians we
cannibals must help these christians



chapter  nantucket


nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning so after a
fine run we safely arrived in nantucket

nantucket take out your map and look at it see what a real corner of
the world it occupies how it stands there away off shore more lonely
than the eddystone lighthouse look at ita mere hillock and elbow of
sand all beach without a background there is more sand there than
you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper some
gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there they
dont grow naturally that they import canada thistles that they have
to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that
pieces of wood in nantucket are carried about like bits of the true
cross in rome that people there plant toadstools before their houses
to get under the shade in summer time that one blade of grass makes an
oasis three blades in a days walk a prairie that they wear quicksand
shoes something like laplander snowshoes that they are so shut up
belted about every way inclosed surrounded and made an utter island
of by the ocean that to their very chairs and tables small clams will
sometimes be found adhering as to the backs of sea turtles but these
extravaganzas only show that nantucket is no illinois

look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was
settled by the redmen thus goes the legend in olden times an eagle
swooped down upon the new england coast and carried off an infant
indian in his talons with loud lament the parents saw their child borne
out of sight over the wide waters they resolved to follow in the same
direction setting out in their canoes after a perilous passage they
discovered the island and there they found an empty ivory casketthe
poor little indians skeleton

what wonder then that these nantucketers born on a beach should take
to the sea for a livelihood they first caught crabs and quohogs in
the sand grown bolder they waded out with nets for mackerel more
experienced they pushed off in boats and captured cod and at last
launching a navy of great ships on the sea explored this watery world
put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it peeped in
at behrings straits and in all seasons and all oceans declared
everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the
flood most monstrous and most mountainous that himmalehan saltsea
mastodon clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power that
his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and
malicious assaults

and thus have these naked nantucketers these sea hermits issuing from
their anthill in the sea overrun and conquered the watery world like
so many alexanders parcelling out among them the atlantic pacific and
indian oceans as the three pirate powers did poland let america add
mexico to texas and pile cuba upon canada let the english overswarm
all india and hang out their blazing banner from the sun two thirds
of this terraqueous globe are the nantucketers for the sea is his he
owns it as emperors own empires other seamen having but a right of
way through it merchant ships are but extension bridges armed ones but
floating forts even pirates and privateers though following the sea
as highwaymen the road they but plunder other ships other fragments of
the land like themselves without seeking to draw their living from the
bottomless deep itself the nantucketer he alone resides and riots on
the sea he alone in bible language goes down to it in ships to and
fro ploughing it as his own special plantation there is his home there
lies his business which a noahs flood would not interrupt though it
overwhelmed all the millions in china he lives on the sea as prairie
cocks in the prairie he hides among the waves he climbs them as
chamois hunters climb the alps for years he knows not the land so
that when he comes to it at last it smells like another world more
strangely than the moon would to an earthsman with the landless gull
that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows
so at nightfall the nantucketer out of sight of land furls his sails
and lays him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herds of
walruses and whales



chapter  chowder


it was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly
to anchor and queequeg and i went ashore so we could attend to no
business that day at least none but a supper and a bed the landlord of
the spouterinn had recommended us to his cousin hosea hussey of the
try pots whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept
hotels in all nantucket and moreover he had assured us that cousin
hosea as he called him was famous for his chowders in short he
plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try potluck at
the try pots but the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow
warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the
larboard and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a
corner three points to the starboard and that done then ask the first
man we met where the place was these crooked directions of his very
much puzzled us at first especially as at the outset queequeg
insisted that the yellow warehouseour first point of departuremust
be left on the larboard hand whereas i had understood peter coffin to
say it was on the starboard however by dint of beating about a little
in the dark and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant
to inquire the way we at last came to something which there was no
mistaking

two enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by asses ears
swung from the crosstrees of an old topmast planted in front of an
old doorway the horns of the crosstrees were sawed off on the other
side so that this old topmast looked not a little like a gallows
perhaps i was over sensitive to such impressions at the time but i
could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving a sort of
crick was in my neck as i gazed up to the two remaining horns yes two
of them one for queequeg and one for me its ominous thinks i a
coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port tombstones
staring at me in the whalemens chapel and here a gallows and a pair
of prodigious black pots too are these last throwing out oblique hints
touching tophet

i was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman
with yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the inn
under a dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injured
eye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen
shirt

get along with ye said she to the man or ill be combing ye

come on queequeg said i all right theres mrs hussey

and so it turned out mr hosea hussey being from home but leaving
mrs hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs upon
making known our desires for a supper and a bed mrs hussey postponing
further scolding for the present ushered us into a little room and
seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded
repast turned round to us and saidclam or cod

whats that about cods maam said i with much politeness

clam or cod she repeated

a clam for supper a cold clam is that what you mean mrs hussey
says i but thats a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter
time aint it mrs hussey

but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple
shirt who was waiting for it in the entry and seeming to hear nothing
but the word clam mrs hussey hurried towards an open door leading to
the kitchen and bawling out clam for two disappeared

queequeg said i do you think that we can make out a supper for us
both on one clam

however a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the
apparently cheerless prospect before us but when that smoking chowder
came in the mystery was delightfully explained oh sweet friends
hearken to me it was made of small juicy clams scarcely bigger than
hazel nuts mixed with pounded ship biscuit and salted pork cut up into
little flakes the whole enriched with butter and plentifully seasoned
with pepper and salt our appetites being sharpened by the frosty
voyage and in particular queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food
before him and the chowder being surpassingly excellent we despatched
it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and bethinking
me of mrs husseys clam and cod announcement i thought i would try
a little experiment stepping to the kitchen door i uttered the word
cod with great emphasis and resumed my seat in a few moments the
savoury steam came forth again but with a different flavor and in good
time a fine codchowder was placed before us

we resumed business and while plying our spoons in the bowl thinks i
to myself i wonder now if this here has any effect on the head
whats that stultifying saying about chowderheaded people but look
queequeg aint that a live eel in your bowl wheres your harpoon

fishiest of all fishy places was the try pots which well deserved
its name for the pots there were always boiling chowders chowder for
breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper till you
began to look for fishbones coming through your clothes the area
before the house was paved with clamshells mrs hussey wore a polished
necklace of codfish vertebra and hosea hussey had his account books
bound in superior old sharkskin there was a fishy flavor to the milk
too which i could not at all account for till one morning happening
to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermens boats i saw
hoseas brindled cow feeding on fish remnants and marching along the
sand with each foot in a cods decapitated head looking very slipshod
i assure ye

supper concluded we received a lamp and directions from mrs hussey
concerning the nearest way to bed but as queequeg was about to precede
me up the stairs the lady reached forth her arm and demanded his
harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chambers why not said i
every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoonbut why not because
its dangerous says she ever since young stiggs coming from that
unfortnt vyge of his when he was gone four years and a half with
only three barrels of ile was found dead in my first floor back with
his harpoon in his side ever since then i allow no boarders to take
sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night so mr queequeg for
she had learned his name i will just take this here iron and keep
it for you till morning but the chowder clam or cod tomorrow for
breakfast men

both says i and lets have a couple of smoked herring by way of
variety



chapter  the ship


in bed we concocted our plans for the morrow but to my surprise and
no small concern queequeg now gave me to understand that he had been
diligently consulting yojothe name of his black little godand yojo
had told him two or three times over and strongly insisted upon it
everyway that instead of our going together among the whalingfleet in
harbor and in concert selecting our craft instead of this i say yojo
earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly
with me inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us and in order to
do so had already pitched upon a vessel which if left to myself i
ishmael should infallibly light upon for all the world as though it
had turned out by chance and in that vessel i must immediately ship
myself for the present irrespective of queequeg

i have forgotten to mention that in many things queequeg placed great
confidence in the excellence of yojos judgment and surprising forecast
of things and cherished yojo with considerable esteem as a rather good
sort of god who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole but in all
cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs

now this plan of queequegs or rather yojos touching the selection
of our craft i did not like that plan at all i had not a little relied
upon queequegs sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry
us and our fortunes securely but as all my remonstrances produced
no effect upon queequeg i was obliged to acquiesce and accordingly
prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort
of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that trifling little
affair next morning early leaving queequeg shut up with yojo in our
little bedroomfor it seemed that it was some sort of lent or ramadan
or day of fasting humiliation and prayer with queequeg and yojo that
day how it was i never could find out for though i applied myself
to it several times i never could master his liturgies and xxxix
articlesleaving queequeg then fasting on his tomahawk pipe and yojo
warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings i sallied out among
the shipping after much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries
i learnt that there were three ships up for threeyears voyagesthe
devildam the titbit and the pequod devildam i do not know the
origin of titbit is obvious pequod you will no doubt remember was
the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians now extinct
as the ancient medes i peered and pryed about the devildam from her
hopped over to the titbit and finally going on board the pequod
looked around her for a moment and then decided that this was the very
ship for us

you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught i
knowsquaretoed luggers mountainous japanese junks butterbox
galliots and what not but take my word for it you never saw such a
rare old craft as this same rare old pequod she was a ship of the old
school rather small if anything with an oldfashioned clawfooted look
about her long seasoned and weatherstained in the typhoons and calms
of all four oceans her old hulls complexion was darkened like a french
grenadiers who has alike fought in egypt and siberia her venerable
bows looked bearded her mastscut somewhere on the coast of japan
where her original ones were lost overboard in a galeher masts stood
stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of cologne her
ancient decks were worn and wrinkled like the pilgrimworshipped
flagstone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled but to all these
her old antiquities were added new and marvellous features pertaining
to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed
old captain peleg many years her chiefmate before he commanded
another vessel of his own and now a retired seaman and one of the
principal owners of the pequodthis old peleg during the term of his
chiefmateship had built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaid
it all over with a quaintness both of material and device unmatched
by anything except it be thorkillhakes carved buckler or bedstead she
was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor his neck heavy with
pendants of polished ivory she was a thing of trophies a cannibal of
a craft tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies all
round her unpanelled open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous
jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale inserted there for
pins to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to those thews ran not
through base blocks of land wood but deftly travelled over sheaves of
seaivory scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm she sported
there a tiller and that tiller was in one mass curiously carved
from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe the helmsman who
steered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the tartar when he holds
back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw a noble craft but somehow a
most melancholy all noble things are touched with that

now when i looked about the quarterdeck for some one having authority
in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage at first i saw
nobody but i could not well overlook a strange sort of tent or
rather wigwam pitched a little behind the mainmast it seemed only
a temporary erection used in port it was of a conical shape some ten
feet high consisting of the long huge slabs of limber black bone taken
from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the rightwhale
planted with their broad ends on the deck a circle of these slabs laced
together mutually sloped towards each other and at the apex united in
a tufted point where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the
topknot on some old pottowottamie sachems head a triangular opening
faced towards the bows of the ship so that the insider commanded a
complete view forward

and half concealed in this queer tenement i at length found one who
by his aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon and
the ships work suspended was now enjoying respite from the burden of
command he was seated on an oldfashioned oaken chair wriggling all
over with curious carving and the bottom of which was formed of a
stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was
constructed

there was nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance of
the elderly man i saw he was brown and brawny like most old seamen
and heavily rolled up in blue pilotcloth cut in the quaker style
only there was a fine and almost microscopic network of the minutest
wrinkles interlacing round his eyes which must have arisen from
his continual sailings in many hard gales and always looking to
windwardfor this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed
together such eyewrinkles are very effectual in a scowl

is this the captain of the pequod said i advancing to the door of
the tent

supposing it be the captain of the pequod what dost thou want of him
he demanded

i was thinking of shipping

thou wast wast thou i see thou art no nantucketerever been in a
stove boat

no sir i never have

dost know nothing at all about whaling i dare sayeh

nothing sir but i have no doubt i shall soon learn ive been several
voyages in the merchant service and i think that

merchant service be damned talk not that lingo to me dost see that
legill take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou talkest of
the marchant service to me again marchant service indeed i suppose now
ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships
but flukes man what makes thee want to go a whaling ehit looks
a little suspicious dont it ehhast not been a pirate hast
thoudidst not rob thy last captain didst thoudost not think of
murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea

i protested my innocence of these things i saw that under the mask
of these half humorous innuendoes this old seaman as an insulated
quakerish nantucketer was full of his insular prejudices and rather
distrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from cape cod or the
vineyard

but what takes thee awhaling i want to know that before i think of
shipping ye

well sir i want to see what whaling is i want to see the world

want to see what whaling is eh have ye clapped eye on captain ahab

who is captain ahab sir

aye aye i thought so captain ahab is the captain of this ship

i am mistaken then i thought i was speaking to the captain himself

thou art speaking to captain pelegthats who ye are speaking to
young man it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fitted
out for the voyage and supplied with all her needs including crew we
are part owners and agents but as i was going to say if thou wantest
to know what whaling is as thou tellest ye do i can put ye in a way of
finding it out before ye bind yourself to it past backing out clap
eye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that he has only one
leg

what do you mean sir was the other one lost by a whale

lost by a whale young man come nearer to me it was devoured
chewed up crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a
boatah ah

i was a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touched at
the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said as calmly as i
could what you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could i know
there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed
i might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident

look ye now young man thy lungs are a sort of soft dye see thou
dost not talk shark a bit sure yeve been to sea before now sure of
that

sir said i i thought i told you that i had been four voyages in the
merchant

hard down out of that mind what i said about the marchant
servicedont aggravate mei wont have it but let us understand each
other i have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feel
inclined for it

i do sir

very good now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whales
throat and then jump after it answer quick

i am sir if it should be positively indispensable to do so not to be
got rid of that is which i dont take to be the fact

good again now then thou not only wantest to go awhaling to find
out by experience what whaling is but ye also want to go in order to
see the world was not that what ye said i thought so well then just
step forward there and take a peep over the weatherbow and then back
to me and tell me what ye see there

for a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request not
knowing exactly how to take it whether humorously or in earnest but
concentrating all his crows feet into one scowl captain peleg started
me on the errand

going forward and glancing over the weather bow i perceived that the
ship swinging to her anchor with the floodtide was now obliquely
pointing towards the open ocean the prospect was unlimited but
exceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slightest variety that i
could see

well whats the report said peleg when i came back what did ye
see

not much i repliednothing but water considerable horizon though
and theres a squall coming up i think

well what does thou think then of seeing the world do ye wish to go
round cape horn to see any more of it eh cant ye see the world where
you stand

i was a little staggered but go awhaling i must and i would and the
pequod was as good a ship as anyi thought the bestand all this i now
repeated to peleg seeing me so determined he expressed his willingness
to ship me

and thou mayest as well sign the papers right off he addedcome
along with ye and so saying he led the way below deck into the cabin

seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and
surprising figure it turned out to be captain bildad who along with
captain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel the other
shares as is sometimes the case in these ports being held by a crowd
of old annuitants widows fatherless children and chancery wards each
owning about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail
or two in the ship people in nantucket invest their money in whaling
vessels the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks
bringing in good interest

now bildad like peleg and indeed many other nantucketers was a
quaker the island having been originally settled by that sect and to
this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the
peculiarities of the quaker only variously and anomalously modified
by things altogether alien and heterogeneous for some of these same
quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whalehunters they
are fighting quakers they are quakers with a vengeance

so that there are instances among them of men who named with scripture
namesa singularly common fashion on the islandand in childhood
naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker
idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless adventure
of their subsequent lives strangely blend with these unoutgrown
peculiarities a thousand bold dashes of character not unworthy a
scandinavian seaking or a poetical pagan roman and when these things
unite in a man of greatly superior natural force with a globular brain
and a ponderous heart who has also by the stillness and seclusion
of many long nightwatches in the remotest waters and beneath
constellations never seen here at the north been led to think
untraditionally and independently receiving all natures sweet or
savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding
breast and thereby chiefly but with some help from accidental
advantages to learn a bold and nervous lofty languagethat man makes
one in a whole nations censusa mighty pageant creature formed for
noble tragedies nor will it at all detract from him dramatically
regarded if either by birth or other circumstances he have what seems
a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature for all
men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness be sure
of this o young ambition all mortal greatness is but disease but
as yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite another and
still a man who if indeed peculiar it only results again from another
phase of the quaker modified by individual circumstances

like captain peleg captain bildad was a welltodo retired whaleman
but unlike captain pelegwho cared not a rush for what are called
serious things and indeed deemed those selfsame serious things the
veriest of all triflescaptain bildad had not only been originally
educated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism but all
his subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovely island
creatures round the hornall that had not moved this native born
quaker one single jot had not so much as altered one angle of his
