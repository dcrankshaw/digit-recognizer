moby dick or the whale
by herman melville
chapter 1 loomings
call me ishmael some years agonever mind how long preciselyhaving
little or no money in my purse and nothing particular to interest me on
shore i thought i would sail about a little and see the watery part of
the world it is a way i have of driving off the spleen and regulating
the circulation whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth
whenever it is a damp drizzly november in my soul whenever i find
myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses and bringing up
the rear of every funeral i meet and especially whenever my hypos get
such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to
prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and methodically
knocking peoples hats offthen i account it high time to get to sea
as soon as i can this is my substitute for pistol and ball with a
philosophical flourish cato throws himself upon his sword i quietly
take to the ship there is nothing surprising in this if they but knew
it almost all men in their degree some time or other cherish very
nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me

there now is your insular city of the manhattoes belted round by
wharves as indian isles by coral reefscommerce surrounds it with
her surf right and left the streets take you waterward its extreme
downtown is the battery where that noble mole is washed by waves and
cooled by breezes which a few hours previous were out of sight of land
look at the crowds of watergazers there

circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go from corlears
hook to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what
do you seeposted like silent sentinels all around the town stand
thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries some
leaning against the spiles some seated upon the pierheads some
looking over the bulwarks of ships from china some high aloft in the
rigging as if striving to get a still better seaward peep but these
are all landsmen of week days pent up in lath and plastertied to
counters nailed to benches clinched to desks how then is this are
the green fields gone what do they here

but look here come more crowds pacing straight for the water and
seemingly bound for a dive strange nothing will content them but the
extremest limit of the land loitering under the shady lee of yonder
warehouses will not suffice no they must get just as nigh the water
as they possibly can without falling in and there they standmiles of
themleagues inlanders all they come from lanes and alleys streets
and avenuesnorth east south and west yet here they all unite
tell me does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all
those ships attract them thither

once more say you are in the country in some high land of lakes take
almost any path you please and ten to one it carries you down in a
dale and leaves you there by a pool in the stream there is magic
in it let the most absentminded of men be plunged in his deepest
reveriesstand that man on his legs set his feet agoing and he will
infallibly lead you to water if water there be in all that region
should you ever be athirst in the great american desert try this
experiment if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical
professor yes as every one knows meditation and water are wedded for
ever

but here is an artist he desires to paint you the dreamiest shadiest
quietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of
the saco what is the chief element he employs there stand his trees
each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and a crucifix were within and
here sleeps his meadow and there sleep his cattle and up from yonder
cottage goes a sleepy smoke deep into distant woodlands winds a
mazy way reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their
hillside blue but though the picture lies thus tranced and though
this pinetree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherds
head yet all were vain unless the shepherds eye were fixed upon the
magic stream before him go visit the prairies in june when for scores
on scores of miles you wade kneedeep among tigerlilieswhat is the
one charm wantingwaterthere is not a drop of water there were
niagara but a cataract of sand would you travel your thousand miles to
see it why did the poor poet of tennessee upon suddenly receiving two
handfuls of silver deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly
needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why
is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him at
some time or other crazy to go to sea why upon your first voyage as a
passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first
told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land why did the
old persians hold the sea holy why did the greeks give it a separate
deity and own brother of jove surely all this is not without meaning
and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because
he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain
plunged into it and was drowned but that same image we ourselves see
in all rivers and oceans it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of
life and this is the key to it all

now when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin
to grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be over conscious of my lungs
i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as a passenger
for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse and a purse is
but a rag unless you have something in it besides passengers get
seasickgrow quarrelsomedont sleep of nightsdo not enjoy
themselves much as a general thingno i never go as a passenger
nor though i am something of a salt do i ever go to sea as a
commodore or a captain or a cook i abandon the glory and distinction
of such offices to those who like them for my part i abominate all
honourable respectable toils trials and tribulations of every kind
whatsoever it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself
without taking care of ships barques brigs schooners and what not
and as for going as cookthough i confess there is considerable glory
in that a cook being a sort of officer on shipboardyet somehow
i never fancied broiling fowlsthough once broiled judiciously
buttered and judgmatically salted and peppered there is no one who
will speak more respectfully not to say reverentially of a broiled
fowl than i will it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old
egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the
mummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramids

no when i go to sea i go as a simple sailor right before the mast
plumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal masthead
true they rather order me about some and make me jump from spar to
spar like a grasshopper in a may meadow and at first this sort
of thing is unpleasant enough it touches ones sense of honour
particularly if you come of an old established family in the land the
van rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all
if just previous to putting your hand into the tarpot you have been
lording it as a country schoolmaster making the tallest boys stand
in awe of you the transition is a keen one i assure you from a
schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of seneca and
the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it but even this wears off in
time

what of it if some old hunks of a seacaptain orders me to get a broom
and sweep down the decks what does that indignity amount to weighed
i mean in the scales of the new testament do you think the archangel
gabriel thinks anything the less of me because i promptly and
respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance who aint
a slave tell me that well then however the old seacaptains may
order me abouthowever they may thump and punch me about i have the
satisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is
one way or other served in much the same wayeither in a physical
or metaphysical point of view that is and so the universal thump is
passed round and all hands should rub each others shoulderblades and
be content

again i always go to sea as a sailor because they make a point of
paying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passengers a single
penny that i ever heard of on the contrary passengers themselves must
pay and there is all the difference in the world between paying
and being paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable
infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us but being
paidwhat will compare with it the urbane activity with which a man
receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly
believe money to be the root of all earthly ills and that on no account
can a monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully we consign ourselves
to perdition

finally i always go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesome
exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck for as in this world
head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern that is
if you never violate the pythagorean maxim so for the most part the
commodore on the quarterdeck gets his atmosphere at second hand from
the sailors on the forecastle he thinks he breathes it first but not
so in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many
other things at the same time that the leaders little suspect it
but wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a
merchant sailor i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling
voyage this the invisible police officer of the fates who has the
constant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me and influences me
in some unaccountable wayhe can better answer than any one else and
doubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand
programme of providence that was drawn up a long time ago it came in as
a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances
i take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this


grand contested election for the presidency of the united states

whaling voyage by one ishmael

bloody battle in affghanistan


though i cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers the
fates put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage when others
were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies and short and
easy parts in genteel comedies and jolly parts in farcesthough
i cannot tell why this was exactly yet now that i recall all the
circumstances i think i can see a little into the springs and motives
which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises induced
me to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into the
delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill
and discriminating judgment

chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great
whale himself such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my
curiosity then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island
bulk the undeliverable nameless perils of the whale these with all
the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds helped
to sway me to my wish with other men perhaps such things would not
have been inducements but as for me i am tormented with an everlasting
itch for things remote i love to sail forbidden seas and land on
barbarous coasts not ignoring what is good i am quick to perceive a
horror and could still be social with itwould they let mesince it
is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place
one lodges in

by reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome the
great floodgates of the wonderworld swung open and in the wild
conceits that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into
my inmost soul endless processions of the whale and mid most of them
all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air



chapter 2 the carpetbag


i stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpetbag tucked it under my arm
and started for cape horn and the pacific quitting the good city of
old manhatto i duly arrived in new bedford it was a saturday night in
december much was i disappointed upon learning that the little packet
for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reaching that place
would offer till the following monday

as most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at
this same new bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may as well
be related that i for one had no idea of so doing for my mind was
made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft because there was a
fine boisterous something about everything connected with that famous
old island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford has
of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling and though
in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her yet nantucket
was her great originalthe tyre of this carthagethe place where the
first dead american whale was stranded where else but from nantucket
did those aboriginal whalemen the redmen first sally out in canoes to
give chase to the leviathan and where but from nantucket too did that
first adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with imported
cobblestonesso goes the storyto throw at the whales in order to
discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit

now having a night a day and still another night following before me
in new bedford ere i could embark for my destined port it became a
matter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile it was a
very dubiouslooking nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly cold
and cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnels i had
sounded my pocket and only brought up a few pieces of silverso
wherever you go ishmael said i to myself as i stood in the middle of
a dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the
north with the darkness towards the southwherever in your wisdom you
may conclude to lodge for the night my dear ishmael be sure to inquire
the price and dont be too particular

with halting steps i paced the streets and passed the sign of the
crossed harpoonsbut it looked too expensive and jolly there further
on from the bright red windows of the swordfish inn there came such
fervent rays that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from
before the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches
thick in a hard asphaltic pavementrather weary for me when i struck
my foot against the flinty projections because from hard remorseless
service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight too
expensive and jolly again thought i pausing one moment to watch the
broad glare in the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses
within but go on ishmael said i at last dont you hear get away
from before the door your patched boots are stopping the way so on i
went i now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward for
there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest inns

such dreary streets blocks of blackness not houses on either hand
and here and there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb at
this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of
the town proved all but deserted but presently i came to a smoky light
proceeding from a low wide building the door of which stood invitingly
open it had a careless look as if it were meant for the uses of the
public so entering the first thing i did was to stumble over an
ashbox in the porch ha thought i ha as the flying particles almost
choked me are these ashes from that destroyed city gomorrah but the
crossed harpoons and the swordfishthis then must needs be the
sign of the trap however i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice
within pushed on and opened a second interior door

it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundred black
faces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black angel
of doom was beating a book in a pulpit it was a negro church and the
preachers text was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and
wailing and teethgnashing there ha ishmael muttered i backing out
wretched entertainment at the sign of the trap

moving on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks
and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging
sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing
a tall straight jet of misty spray and these words underneaththe
spouter innpeter coffin

coffinspouterrather ominous in that particular connexion thought
i but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i suppose this
peter here is an emigrant from there as the light looked so dim and
the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little
wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from
the ruins of some burnt district and as the swinging sign had a
povertystricken sort of creak to it i thought that here was the very
spot for cheap lodgings and the best of pea coffee

it was a queer sort of placea gableended old house one side palsied
as it were and leaning over sadly it stood on a sharp bleak corner
where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever
it did about poor pauls tossed craft euroclydon nevertheless is a
mighty pleasant zephyr to any one indoors with his feet on the hob
quietly toasting for bed in judging of that tempestuous wind called
euroclydon says an old writerof whose works i possess the only copy
extantit maketh a marvellous difference whether thou lookest out at
it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside or whether
thou observest it from that sashless window where the frost is on both
sides and of which the wight death is the only glazier true enough
thought i as this passage occurred to my mindold blackletter thou
reasonest well yes these eyes are windows and this body of mine is
the house what a pity they didnt stop up the chinks and the crannies
though and thrust in a little lint here and there but its too late
to make any improvements now the universe is finished the copestone
is on and the chips were carted off a million years ago poor lazarus
there chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow and
shaking off his tatters with his shiverings he might plug up both ears
with rags and put a corncob into his mouth and yet that would not
keep out the tempestuous euroclydon euroclydon says old dives in his
red silken wrapperhe had a redder one afterwards pooh pooh what
a fine frosty night how orion glitters what northern lights let them
talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories give
me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals

but what thinks lazarus can he warm his blue hands by holding them up
to the grand northern lights would not lazarus rather be in sumatra
than here would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the
line of the equator yea ye gods go down to the fiery pit itself in
order to keep out this frost

now that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the
door of dives this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be
moored to one of the moluccas yet dives himself he too lives like a
czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and being a president of a
temperance society he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans

but no more of this blubbering now we are going awhaling and there is
plenty of that yet to come let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet
and see what sort of a place this spouter may be



chapter 3 the spouterinn


entering that gableended spouterinn you found yourself in a wide
low straggling entry with oldfashioned wainscots reminding one of
the bulwarks of some condemned old craft on one side hung a very large
oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the
unequal crosslights by which you viewed it it was only by diligent
study and a series of systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of
the neighbors that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its
purpose such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that at first
you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new
england hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched but by dint
of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and
especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the
entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however
wild might not be altogether unwarranted

but what most puzzled and confounded you was a long limber portentous
black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three
blue dim perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast a boggy
soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distracted
yet was there a sort of indefinite halfattained unimaginable
sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it till you involuntarily
took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting
meant ever and anon a bright but alas deceptive idea would dart you
throughits the black sea in a midnight galeits the unnatural
combat of the four primal elementsits a blasted heathits a
hyperborean winter sceneits the breakingup of the icebound stream
of time but at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous
something in the pictures midst that once found out and all the rest
were plain but stop does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic
fish even the great leviathan himself

in fact the artists design seemed this a final theory of my own
partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom
i conversed upon the subject the picture represents a capehorner in a
great hurricane the halffoundered ship weltering there with its three
dismantled masts alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to
spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act of impaling himself
upon the three mastheads

the opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish
array of monstrous clubs and spears some were thickly set with
glittering teeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted with knots of
human hair and one was sickleshaped with a vast handle sweeping round
like the segment made in the newmown grass by a longarmed mower you
shuddered as you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage
could ever have gone a deathharvesting with such a hacking horrifying
implement mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons
all broken and deformed some were storied weapons with this once long
lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago did nathan swain kill fifteen
whales between a sunrise and a sunset and that harpoonso like a
corkscrew nowwas flung in javan seas and run away with by a whale
years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco the original iron entered
nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a
man travelled full forty feet and at last was found imbedded in the
hump

crossing this dusky entry and on through yon lowarched waycut
through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with
fireplaces all roundyou enter the public room a still duskier place
is this with such low ponderous beams above and such old wrinkled
planks beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old crafts
cockpits especially of such a howling night when this corneranchored
old ark rocked so furiously on one side stood a long low shelflike
table covered with cracked glass cases filled with dusty rarities
gathered from this wide worlds remotest nooks projecting from the
further angle of the room stands a darklooking denthe bara rude
attempt at a right whales head be that how it may there stands the
vast arched bone of the whales jaw so wide a coach might almost drive
beneath it within are shabby shelves ranged round with old decanters
bottles flasks and in those jaws of swift destruction like another
cursed jonah by which name indeed they called him bustles a little
withered old man who for their money dearly sells the sailors
deliriums and death

abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison though
true cylinders withoutwithin the villanous green goggling glasses
deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom parallel meridians
rudely pecked into the glass surround these footpads goblets fill to
this mark and your charge is but a penny to this a penny more and so
on to the full glassthe cape horn measure which you may gulp down for
a shilling

upon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about
a table examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander i
sought the landlord and telling him i desired to be accommodated with a
room received for answer that his house was fullnot a bed unoccupied
but avast he added tapping his forehead you haint no objections
to sharing a harpooneers blanket have ye i spose you are goin
awhalin so youd better get used to that sort of thing

i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if i should
ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and
that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the
harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander
further about a strange town on so bitter a night i would put up with
the half of any decent mans blanket

i thought so all right take a seat supperyou want supper
supperll be ready directly

i sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the
battery at one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with
his jackknife stooping over and diligently working away at the space
between his legs he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail but
he didnt make much headway i thought

at last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an
adjoining room it was cold as icelandno fire at allthe landlord
said he couldnt afford it nothing but two dismal tallow candles each
in a winding sheet we were fain to button up our monkey jackets and
hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers but
the fare was of the most substantial kindnot only meat and potatoes
but dumplings good heavens dumplings for supper one young fellow in
a green box coat addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful
manner

my boy said the landlord youll have the nightmare to a dead
sartainty

landlord i whispered that aint the harpooneer is it

oh no said he looking a sort of diabolically funny the harpooneer
is a dark complexioned chap he never eats dumplings he donthe eats
nothing but steaks and he likes em rare

the devil he does says i where is that harpooneer is he here

hell be here afore long was the answer

i could not help it but i began to feel suspicious of this dark
complexioned harpooneer at any rate i made up my mind that if it so
turned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get into
bed before i did

supper over the company went back to the barroom when knowing not
what else to do with myself i resolved to spend the rest of the evening
as a looker on

presently a rioting noise was heard without starting up the landlord
cried thats the grampuss crew i seed her reported in the offing
this morning a three years voyage and a full ship hurrah boys now
well have the latest news from the feegees

a tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry the door was flung open
and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough enveloped in their shaggy
watch coats and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters all
bedarned and ragged and their beards stiff with icicles they seemed an
eruption of bears from labrador they had just landed from their boat
and this was the first house they entered no wonder then that they
made a straight wake for the whales mouththe barwhen the wrinkled
little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all
round one complained of a bad cold in his head upon which jonah
mixed him a pitchlike potion of gin and molasses which he swore was a
sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever never mind of how
long standing or whether caught off the coast of labrador or on the
weather side of an iceisland

the liquor soon mounted into their heads as it generally does even
with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea and they began capering
about most obstreperously

i observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and though
he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own
sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise
as the rest this man interested me at once and since the seagods
had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a
sleepingpartner one so far as this narrative is concerned i will
here venture upon a little description of him he stood full six feet
in height with noble shoulders and a chest like a cofferdam i have
seldom seen such brawn in a man his face was deeply brown and burnt
making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while in the deep
shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give
him much joy his voice at once announced that he was a southerner
and from his fine stature i thought he must be one of those tall
mountaineers from the alleghanian ridge in virginia when the revelry
of his companions had mounted to its height this man slipped away
unobserved and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the
sea in a few minutes however he was missed by his shipmates and
being it seems for some reason a huge favourite with them they raised
a cry of bulkington bulkington wheres bulkington and darted out of
the house in pursuit of him

it was now about nine oclock and the room seeming almost
supernaturally quiet after these orgies i began to congratulate myself
upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance
of the seamen

no man prefers to sleep two in a bed in fact you would a good deal
rather not sleep with your own brother i dont know how it is but
people like to be private when they are sleeping and when it comes to
sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange
town and that stranger a harpooneer then your objections indefinitely
multiply nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should
sleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailors no more sleep
two in a bed at sea than bachelor kings do ashore to be sure they
all sleep together in one apartment but you have your own hammock and
cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin

the more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i abominated the
thought of sleeping with him it was fair to presume that being a
harpooneer his linen or woollen as the case might be would not be of
the tidiest certainly none of the finest i began to twitch all over
besides it was getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be
home and going bedwards suppose now he should tumble in upon me at
midnighthow could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming

landlord ive changed my mind about that harpooneeri shant sleep
with him ill try the bench here

just as you please im sorry i cant spare ye a tablecloth for a
mattress and its a plaguy rough board herefeeling of the knots and
notches but wait a bit skrimshander ive got a carpenters plane
there in the barwait i say and ill make ye snug enough so saying
he procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting
the bench vigorously set to planing away at my bed the while grinning
like an ape the shavings flew right and left till at last the
planeiron came bump against an indestructible knot the landlord was
near spraining his wrist and i told him for heavens sake to quitthe
bed was soft enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planing
in the world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up the
shavings with another grin and throwing them into the great stove in
the middle of the room he went about his business and left me in a
brown study

i now took the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot too
short but that could be mended with a chair but it was a foot too
narrow and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher
than the planed oneso there was no yoking them i then placed the
first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall
leaving a little interval between for my back to settle down in but i
soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under
the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all especially
as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window
and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate
vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the night

the devil fetch that harpooneer thought i but stop couldnt i steal
a march on himbolt his door inside and jump into his bed not to be
wakened by the most violent knockings it seemed no bad idea but upon
second thoughts i dismissed it for who could tell but what the next
morning so soon as i popped out of the room the harpooneer might be
standing in the entry all ready to knock me down

still looking round me again and seeing no possible chance of spending
a sufferable night unless in some other persons bed i began to think
that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against
this unknown harpooneer thinks i ill wait awhile he must be dropping
in before long ill have a good look at him then and perhaps we may
become jolly good bedfellows after alltheres no telling

but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones twos and threes
and going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer

landlord said i what sort of a chap is hedoes he always keep such
late hours it was now hard upon twelve oclock

the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle and seemed to
be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension no he
answered generally hes an early birdairley to bed and airley to
riseyes hes the bird what catches the worm but tonight he went out
a peddling you see and i dont see what on airth keeps him so late
unless may be he cant sell his head

cant sell his headwhat sort of a bamboozingly story is this you
are telling me getting into a towering rage do you pretend to say
landlord that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed saturday
night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head around this town

thats precisely it said the landlord and i told him he couldnt
sell it here the markets overstocked

with what shouted i

with heads to be sure aint there too many heads in the world

i tell you what it is landlord said i quite calmly youd better
stop spinning that yarn to meim not green

may be not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick but i
rayther guess youll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a
slanderin his head

ill break it for him said i now flying into a passion again at this
unaccountable farrago of the landlords

its broke aready said he

broke said ibroke do you mean

sartain and thats the very reason he cant sell it i guess

landlord said i going up to him as cool as mt hecla in a
snowstormlandlord stop whittling you and i must understand one
another and that too without delay i come to your house and want a
bed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half
belongs to a certain harpooneer and about this harpooneer whom i
have not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and
exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling
towards the man whom you design for my bedfellowa sort of connexion
landlord which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest
degree i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this
harpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respects safe to spend the
night with him and in the first place you will be so good as to unsay
that story about selling his head which if true i take to be good
evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and ive no idea of sleeping
with a madman and you sir you i mean landlord you sir by trying
to induce me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable to
a criminal prosecution

wall said the landlord fetching a long breath thats a purty long
sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then but be easy be easy
this here harpooneer i have been tellin you of has just arrived from
the south seas where he bought up a lot of balmed new zealand heads
great curios you know and hes sold all on em but one and that one
hes trying to sell tonight cause tomorrows sunday and it would not
do to be sellin human heads about the streets when folks is goin to
churches he wanted to last sunday but i stopped him just as he was
goin out of the door with four heads strung on a string for all the
airth like a string of inions

this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed
that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling mebut at
the same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a
saturday night clean into the holy sabbath engaged in such a cannibal
business as selling the heads of dead idolators

depend upon it landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous man

he pays reglar was the rejoinder but come its getting dreadful
late you had better be turning flukesits a nice bed sal and me
slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced theres plenty of room
for two to kick about in that bed its an almighty big bed that why
afore we give it up sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the
foot of it but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night and
somehow sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his arm
arter that sal said it wouldnt do come along here ill give ye a
glim in a jiffy and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards
me offering to lead the way but i stood irresolute when looking at a
clock in the corner he exclaimed i vum its sundayyou wont see that
harpooneer tonight hes come to anchor somewherecome along then do
come wont ye come

i considered the matter a moment and then up stairs we went and i was
ushered into a small room cold as a clam and furnished sure enough
with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers
to sleep abreast

there said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest
that did double duty as a washstand and centre table there make
yourself comfortable now and good night to ye i turned round from
eyeing the bed but he had disappeared

folding back the counterpane i stooped over the bed though none of the
most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well i then glanced
round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see
no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf the four
walls and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale of
things not properly belonging to the room there was a hammock lashed
up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a large seamans bag
containing the harpooneers wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk
likewise there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf
over the fireplace and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed

but what is this on the chest i took it up and held it close to the
light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive
at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it i can compare it to
nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edges with little
tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an
indian moccasin there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat
as you see the same in south american ponchos but could it be possible
that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the
streets of any christian town in that sort of guise i put it on to try
it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and
thick and i thought a little damp as though this mysterious harpooneer
had been wearing it of a rainy day i went up in it to a bit of glass
stuck against the wall and i never saw such a sight in my life i tore
myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck

i sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this
headpeddling harpooneer and his door mat after thinking some time on
the bedside i got up and took off my monkey jacket and then stood in
the middle of the room thinking i then took off my coat and thought
a little more in my shirt sleeves but beginning to feel very cold now
half undressed as i was and remembering what the landlord said about
the harpooneers not coming home at all that night it being so very
late i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots and
then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself to the
care of heaven

whether that mattress was stuffed with corncobs or broken crockery
there is no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could not sleep
for a long time at last i slid off into a light doze and had pretty
nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod when i heard a heavy
footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room
from under the door

lord save me thinks i that must be the harpooneer the infernal
headpeddler but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word
till spoken to holding a light in one hand and that identical new
zealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and without
looking towards the bed placed his candle a good way off from me on the
floor in one corner and then began working away at the knotted cords
of the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room i was all
eagerness to see his face but he kept it averted for some time while
employed in unlacing the bags mouth this accomplished however he
turned roundwhen good heavens what a sight such a face it was of
a dark purplish yellow colour here and there stuck over with large
blackish looking squares yes its just as i thought hes a terrible
bedfellow hes been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he is
just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanced to turn his face
so towards the light that i plainly saw they could not be
stickingplasters at all those black squares on his cheeks they were
stains of some sort or other at first i knew not what to make of this
but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me i remembered a story of
a white mana whaleman toowho falling among the cannibals had been
tattooed by them i concluded that this harpooneer in the course of his
distant voyages must have met with a similar adventure and what is it
thought i after all its only his outside a man can be honest in any
sort of skin but then what to make of his unearthly complexion that
part of it i mean lying round about and completely independent of the
squares of tattooing to be sure it might be nothing but a good coat of
tropical tanning but i never heard of a hot suns tanning a white man
into a purplish yellow one however i had never been in the south seas
and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the
skin now while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning
this harpooneer never noticed me at all but after some difficulty
having opened his bag he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled
out a sort of tomahawk and a sealskin wallet with the hair on placing
these on the old chest in the middle of the room he then took the new
zealand heada ghastly thing enoughand crammed it down into the bag
he now took off his hata new beaver hatwhen i came nigh singing out
with fresh surprise there was no hair on his headnone to speak of at
leastnothing but a small scalpknot twisted up on his forehead his
bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull
had not the stranger stood between me and the door i would have bolted
out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner

even as it was i thought something of slipping out of the window but
it was the second floor back i am no coward but what to make of
this headpeddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension
ignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed and
confounded about the stranger i confess i was now as much afraid of him
as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at
the dead of night in fact i was so afraid of him that i was not
game enough just then to address him and demand a satisfactory answer
concerning what seemed inexplicable in him

meanwhile he continued the business of undressing and at last showed
his chest and arms as i live these covered parts of him were checkered
with the same squares as his face his back too was all over the same
dark squares he seemed to have been in a thirty years war and just
escaped from it with a stickingplaster shirt still more his very
legs were marked as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up
the trunks of young palms it was now quite plain that he must be some
abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south
seas and so landed in this christian country i quaked to think of it
a peddler of heads tooperhaps the heads of his own brothers he might
take a fancy to mineheavens look at that tomahawk

but there was no time for shuddering for now the savage went about
something that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me that
he must indeed be a heathen going to his heavy grego or wrapall or
dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he fumbled in the
pockets and produced at length a curious little deformed image with
a hunch on its back and exactly the colour of a three days old congo
baby remembering the embalmed head at first i almost thought that
this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner but
seeing that it was not at all limber and that it glistened a good deal
like polished ebony i concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden
idol which indeed it proved to be for now the savage goes up to the
empty fireplace and removing the papered fireboard sets up this
little hunchbacked image like a tenpin between the andirons the
chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty so that i
thought this fireplace made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel
for his congo idol

i now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image feeling but
ill at ease meantimeto see what was next to follow first he takes
about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket and places
them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of ship biscuit on
top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shavings into
a sacrificial blaze presently after many hasty snatches into the fire
and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers whereby he seemed to be
scorching them badly he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit
then blowing off the heat and ashes a little he made a polite offer of
it to the little negro but the little devil did not seem to fancy such
dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lips all these strange
antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the
devotee who seemed to be praying in a singsong or else singing some
pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the
most unnatural manner at last extinguishing the fire he took the idol
up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocket as
carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock

all these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness and
seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business
operations and jumping into bed with me i thought it was high time
now or never before the light was put out to break the spell in which
i had so long been bound

but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say was a fatal one
taking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head of it for an
instant and then holding it to the light with his mouth at the handle
he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke the next moment the light
was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth
sprang into bed with me i sang out i could not help it now and giving
a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me

stammering out something i knew not what i rolled away from him
against the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he might
be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again but his
guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my
meaning

whoe debel youhe at last saidyou no speake damme i kille
and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the
dark

landlord for gods sake peter coffin shouted i landlord watch
coffin angels save me

speake tellee me whoee be or damme i kille again growled the
cannibal while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the
hot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen would get on fire
but thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room light
in hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him

dont be afraid now said he grinning again queequeg here wouldnt
harm a hair of your head

stop your grinning shouted i and why didnt you tell me that that
infernal harpooneer was a cannibal

i thought ye knowd itdidnt i tell ye he was a peddlin heads
around townbut turn flukes again and go to sleep queequeg look
hereyou sabbee me i sabbeeyou this man sleepe youyou sabbee

me sabbee plentygrunted queequeg puffing away at his pipe and
sitting up in bed

you gettee in he added motioning to me with his tomahawk and
throwing the clothes to one side he really did this in not only a civil
but a really kind and charitable way i stood looking at him a moment
for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean comely looking
cannibal whats all this fuss i have been making about thought i to
myselfthe mans a human being just as i am he has just as much reason
to fear me as i have to be afraid of him better sleep with a sober
cannibal than a drunken christian

landlord said i tell him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or
whatever you call it tell him to stop smoking in short and i will
turn in with him but i dont fancy having a man smoking in bed with me
its dangerous besides i aint insured

this being told to queequeg he at once complied and again politely
motioned me to get into bedrolling over to one side as much as to
sayi wont touch a leg of ye

good night landlord said i you may go

i turned in and never slept better in my life



chapter 4 the counterpane


upon waking next morning about daylight i found queequegs arm thrown
over me in the most loving and affectionate manner you had almost
thought i had been his wife the counterpane was of patchwork full of
odd little particoloured squares and triangles and this arm of his
tattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure
no two parts of which were of one precise shadeowing i suppose to
his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade his shirt
sleeves irregularly rolled up at various timesthis same arm of his i
say looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt
indeed partly lying on it as the arm did when i first awoke i could
hardly tell it from the quilt they so blended their hues together and
it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that i could tell that
queequeg was hugging me

my sensations were strange let me try to explain them when i was a
child i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me
whether it was a reality or a dream i never could entirely settle
the circumstance was this i had been cutting up some caper or otheri
think it was trying to crawl up the chimney as i had seen a little
sweep do a few days previous and my stepmother who somehow or other
was all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperlessmy
mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to
bed though it was only two oclock in the afternoon of the 21st june
the longest day in the year in our hemisphere i felt dreadfully but
there was no help for it so up stairs i went to my little room in the
third floor undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time
and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets

i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse
before i could hope for a resurrection sixteen hours in bed the
small of my back ached to think of it and it was so light too the
sun shining in at the window and a great rattling of coaches in the
streets and the sound of gay voices all over the house i felt worse
and worseat last i got up dressed and softly going down in my
stockinged feet sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself
at her feet beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good
slippering for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemning me to lie
abed such an unendurable length of time but she was the best and most
conscientious of stepmothers and back i had to go to my room for
several hours i lay there broad awake feeling a great deal worse than i
have ever done since even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes at
last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and slowly
waking from ithalf steeped in dreamsi opened my eyes and the before
sunlit room was now wrapped in outer darkness instantly i felt a shock
running through all my frame nothing was to be seen and nothing was
to be heard but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine my arm hung
over the counterpane and the nameless unimaginable silent form
or phantom to which the hand belonged seemed closely seated by my
bedside for what seemed ages piled on ages i lay there frozen with
the most awful fears not daring to drag away my hand yet ever thinking
that if i could but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would be
broken i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me
but waking in the morning i shudderingly remembered it all and for
days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself in confounding
attempts to explain the mystery nay to this very hour i often puzzle
myself with it

now take away the awful fear and my sensations at feeling the
supernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to
those which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequegs pagan
arm thrown round me but at length all the past nights events soberly
recurred one by one in fixed reality and then i lay only alive to
the comical predicament for though i tried to move his armunlock his
bridegroom claspyet sleeping as he was he still hugged me tightly
as though naught but death should part us twain i now strove to rouse
himqueequegbut his only answer was a snore i then rolled over
my neck feeling as if it were in a horsecollar and suddenly felt a
slight scratch throwing aside the counterpane there lay the tomahawk
sleeping by the savages side as if it were a hatchetfaced baby a
pretty pickle truly thought i abed here in a strange house in the
broad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk queequegin the name of
goodness queequeg wake at length by dint of much wriggling and
loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his
hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style i succeeded in
extracting a grunt and presently he drew back his arm shook himself
all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in bed
stiff as a pikestaff looking at me and rubbing his eyes as if he
did not altogether remember how i came to be there though a dim
consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over
him meanwhile i lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgivings
now and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature when at
last his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow
and he became as it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out upon
the floor and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that
if it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress
afterwards leaving the whole apartment to myself thinks i queequeg
under the circumstances this is a very civilized overture but the
truth is these savages have an innate sense of delicacy say what
you will it is marvellous how essentially polite they are i pay this
particular compliment to queequeg because he treated me with so much
civility and consideration while i was guilty of great rudeness
staring at him from the bed and watching all his toilette motions for
the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding nevertheless
a man like queequeg you dont see every day he and his ways were well
worth unusual regarding

he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tall one
by the by and thenstill minus his trowsershe hunted up his boots
what under the heavens he did it for i cannot tell but his next
movement was to crush himselfboots in hand and hat onunder the bed
when from sundry violent gaspings and strainings i inferred he was
hard at work booting himself though by no law of propriety that i ever
heard of is any man required to be private when putting on his
boots but queequeg do you see was a creature in the transition
stageneither caterpillar nor butterfly he was just enough civilized
to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners his
education was not yet completed he was an undergraduate if he had not
been a small degree civilized he very probably would not have troubled
himself with boots at all but then if he had not been still a savage
he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on at
last he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his
eyes and began creaking and limping about the room as if not
being much accustomed to boots his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide
onesprobably not made to order eitherrather pinched and tormented
him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning

seeing now that there were no curtains to the window and that the
street being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain view
into the room and observing more and more the indecorous figure that
queequeg made staving about with little else but his hat and boots on
i begged him as well as i could to accelerate his toilet somewhat
and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible he
complied and then proceeded to wash himself at that time in the
morning any christian would have washed his face but queequeg to
my amazement contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his
chest arms and hands he then donned his waistcoat and taking up a
piece of hard soap on the washstand centre table dipped it into water
and commenced lathering his face i was watching to see where he kept
his razor when lo and behold he takes the harpoon from the bed corner
slips out the long wooden stock unsheathes the head whets it a little
on his boot and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall
begins a vigorous scraping or rather harpooning of his cheeks thinks
i queequeg this is using rogerss best cutlery with a vengeance
afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of
what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp
the long straight edges are always kept

the rest of his toilet was soon achieved and he proudly marched out of
the room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket and sporting his
harpoon like a marshals baton



chapter 5 breakfast


i quickly followed suit and descending into the barroom accosted the
grinning landlord very pleasantly i cherished no malice towards him
though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my
bedfellow

however a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a
good thing the mores the pity so if any one man in his own
proper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not be
backward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in
that way and the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him
be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for

the barroom was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the
night previous and whom i had not as yet had a good look at they were
nearly all whalemen chief mates and second mates and third mates and
sea carpenters and sea coopers and sea blacksmiths and harpooneers
and ship keepers a brown and brawny company with bosky beards an
unshorn shaggy set all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns

you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore this
young fellows healthy cheek is like a suntoasted pear in hue and
would seem to smell almost as musky he cannot have been three days
landed from his indian voyage that man next him looks a few shades
lighter you might say a touch of satin wood is in him in the
complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightly bleached
withal he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore but who could show
a cheek like queequeg which barred with various tints seemed like the
andes western slope to show forth in one array contrasting climates
zone by zone

grub ho now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in we went
to breakfast

they say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at ease
in manner quite selfpossessed in company not always though ledyard
the great new england traveller and mungo park the scotch one of all
men they possessed the least assurance in the parlor but perhaps the
mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as ledyard did or
the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negro heart
of africa which was the sum of poor mungos performancesthis kind of
travel i say may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social
polish still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had
anywhere

these reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that
after we were all seated at the table and i was preparing to hear some
good stories about whaling to my no small surprise nearly every
man maintained a profound silence and not only that but they looked
embarrassed yes here were a set of seadogs many of whom without the
slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seasentire
strangers to themand duelled them dead without winking and yet here
they sat at a social breakfast tableall of the same calling all of
kindred tasteslooking round as sheepishly at each other as though they
had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains
a curious sight these bashful bears these timid warrior whalemen

but as for queequegwhy queequeg sat there among themat the head of
the table too it so chanced as cool as an icicle to be sure i cannot
say much for his breeding his greatest admirer could not have cordially
justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him and using it
there without ceremony reaching over the table with it to the imminent
jeopardy of many heads and grappling the beefsteaks towards him but
that was certainly very coolly done by him and every one knows that in
most peoples estimation to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly

we will not speak of all queequegs peculiarities here how he eschewed
coffee and hot rolls and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks
done rare enough that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the
rest into the public room lighted his tomahawkpipe and was sitting
there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when i
sallied out for a stroll



chapter 6 the street


if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish
an individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of a
civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first
daylight stroll through the streets of new bedford

in thoroughfares nigh the docks any considerable seaport will
frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign
parts even in broadway and chestnut streets mediterranean mariners
will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies regent street is not
unknown to lascars and malays and at bombay in the apollo green live
yankees have often scared the natives but new bedford beats all water
street and wapping in these lastmentioned haunts you see only sailors
but in new bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners
savages outright many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh it
makes a stranger stare

but besides the feegeeans tongatobooarrs erromanggoans pannangians
and brighggians and besides the wild specimens of the whalingcraft
which unheeded reel about the streets you will see other sights still
more curious certainly more comical there weekly arrive in this town
scores of green vermonters and new hampshire men all athirst for gain
and glory in the fishery they are mostly young of stalwart frames
fellows who have felled forests and now seek to drop the axe and snatch
the whalelance many are as green as the green mountains whence they
came in some things you would think them but a few hours old look
there that chap strutting round the corner he wears a beaver hat and
swallowtailed coat girdled with a sailorbelt and sheathknife here
comes another with a souwester and a bombazine cloak

no townbred dandy will compare with a countrybred onei mean a
downright bumpkin dandya fellow that in the dogdays will mow his
two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands now when a
country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished
reputation and joins the great whalefishery you should see the
comical things he does upon reaching the seaport in bespeaking his
seaoutfit he orders bellbuttons to his waistcoats straps to his
canvas trowsers ah poor hayseed how bitterly will burst those straps
in the first howling gale when thou art driven straps buttons and
all down the throat of the tempest

but think not that this famous town has only harpooneers cannibals and
bumpkins to show her visitors not at all still new bedford is a queer
place had it not been for us whalemen that tract of land would this
day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of labrador
as it is parts of her back country are enough to frighten one they
look so bony the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live
in in all new england it is a land of oil true enough but not like
canaan a land also of corn and wine the streets do not run with
milk nor in the springtime do they pave them with fresh eggs yet in
spite of this nowhere in all america will you find more patricianlike
houses parks and gardens more opulent than in new bedford whence came
they how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country

go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
mansion and your question will be answered yes all these brave houses
and flowery gardens came from the atlantic pacific and indian oceans
one and all they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom
of the sea can herr alexander perform a feat like that

in new bedford fathers they say give whales for dowers to their
daughters and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises apiece
you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding for they say
they have reservoirs of oil in every house and every night recklessly
burn their lengths in spermaceti candles

in summer time the town is sweet to see full of fine mapleslong
avenues of green and gold and in august high in air the beautiful and
bountiful horsechestnuts candelabrawise proffer the passerby their
tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms so omnipotent is art
which in many a district of new bedford has superinduced bright terraces
of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creations final
day

and the women of new bedford they bloom like their own red roses but
roses only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks
is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens elsewhere match that
bloom of theirs ye cannot save in salem where they tell me the young
girls breathe such musk their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off
shore as though they were drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of
the puritanic sands



chapter 7 the chapel


in this same new bedford there stands a whalemans chapel and few are
the moody fishermen shortly bound for the indian ocean or pacific who
fail to make a sunday visit to the spot i am sure that i did not

returning from my first morning stroll i again sallied out upon this
special errand the sky had changed from clear sunny cold to driving
sleet and mist wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called
bearskin i fought my way against the stubborn storm entering i
found a small scattered congregation of sailors and sailors wives and
widows a muffled silence reigned only broken at times by the shrieks
of the storm each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from
the other as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable the
chaplain had not yet arrived and there these silent islands of men and
women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets with black borders
masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit three of them ran
something like the following but i do not pretend to quote

sacred to the memory of john talbot who at the age of eighteen was
lost overboard near the isle of desolation off patagonia november
1st 1836 this tablet is erected to his memory by his sister

sacred to the memory of robert long willis ellery nathan coleman
walter canny seth macy and samuel gleig forming one of the boats
crews of the ship eliza who were towed out of sight by a whale on the
offshore ground in the pacific december 31st 1839 this marble is
here placed by their surviving shipmates

sacred to the memory of the late captain ezekiel hardy who in the bows
of his boat was killed by a sperm whale on the coast of japan august
3d 1833 this tablet is erected to his memory by his widow

shaking off the sleet from my iceglazed hat and jacket i seated myself
near the door and turning sideways was surprised to see queequeg near
me affected by the solemnity of the scene there was a wondering gaze
of incredulous curiosity in his countenance this savage was the only
person present who seemed to notice my entrance because he was the only
one who could not read and therefore was not reading those frigid
inscriptions on the wall whether any of the relatives of the seamen
whose names appeared there were now among the congregation i knew not
but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery and so plainly
did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings
of some unceasing grief that i feel sure that here before me were
assembled those in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak
tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh

oh ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass who standing among
flowers can sayhere here lies my beloved ye know not the desolation
that broods in bosoms like these what bitter blanks in those
blackbordered marbles which cover no ashes what despair in those
immovable inscriptions what deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in
the lines that seem to gnaw upon all faith and refuse resurrections to
the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave as well might
those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta as here

in what census of living creatures the dead of mankind are included
why it is that a universal proverb says of them that they tell no
tales though containing more secrets than the goodwin sands how it is
that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world we prefix
so significant and infidel a word and yet do not thus entitle him if
he but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth why the
life insurance companies pay deathforfeitures upon immortals in what
eternal unstirring paralysis and deadly hopeless trance yet lies
antique adam who died sixty round centuries ago how it is that we
still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are
dwelling in unspeakable bliss why all the living so strive to hush all
the dead wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a
whole city all these things are not without their meanings

but faith like a jackal feeds among the tombs and even from these
dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope

it needs scarcely to be told with what feelings on the eve of a
nantucket voyage i regarded those marble tablets and by the murky
light of that darkened doleful day read the fate of the whalemen
who had gone before me yes ishmael the same fate may be thine but
somehow i grew merry again delightful inducements to embark fine
chance for promotion it seemsaye a stove boat will make me an
immortal by brevet yes there is death in this business of whalinga
speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity but what
then methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death
methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true
substance methinks that in looking at things spiritual we are too
much like oysters observing the sun through the water and thinking that
thick water the thinnest of air methinks my body is but the lees of my
better being in fact take my body who will take it i say it is not
me and therefore three cheers for nantucket and come a stove boat and
stove body when they will for stave my soul jove himself cannot



chapter 8 the pulpit


i had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
robustness entered immediately as the stormpelted door flew back upon
admitting him a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation
sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain yes it
was the famous father mapple so called by the whalemen among whom he
was a very great favourite he had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his
youth but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry
at the time i now write of father mapple was in the hardy winter of a
healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merging into a second
flowering youth for among all the fissures of his wrinkles there shone
certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloomthe spring verdure
peeping forth even beneath februarys snow no one having previously
heard his history could for the first time behold father mapple without
the utmost interest because there were certain engrafted clerical
peculiarities about him imputable to that adventurous maritime life
he had led when he entered i observed that he carried no umbrella and
certainly had not come in his carriage for his tarpaulin hat ran down
with melting sleet and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to
drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed
however hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed and hung up
in a little space in an adjacent corner when arrayed in a decent suit
he quietly approached the pulpit

like most old fashioned pulpits it was a very lofty one and since a
regular stairs to such a height would by its long angle with the floor
seriously contract the already small area of the chapel the architect
it seemed had acted upon the hint of father mapple and finished the
pulpit without a stairs substituting a perpendicular side ladder like
those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea the wife of a whaling
captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted
manropes for this ladder which being itself nicely headed and
stained with a mahogany colour the whole contrivance considering what
manner of chapel it was seemed by no means in bad taste halting for
an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both hands grasping the
ornamental knobs of the manropes father mapple cast a look upwards
and then with a truly sailorlike but still reverential dexterity hand
over hand mounted the steps as if ascending the maintop of his vessel

the perpendicular parts of this side ladder as is usually the case with
swinging ones were of clothcovered rope only the rounds were of wood
so that at every step there was a joint at my first glimpse of the
pulpit it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship
these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary for i was not
prepared to see father mapple after gaining the height slowly turn
round and stooping over the pulpit deliberately drag up the ladder
step by step till the whole was deposited within leaving him
impregnable in his little quebec

i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this
father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity
that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks
of the stage no thought i there must be some sober reason for this
thing furthermore it must symbolize something unseen can it be
then that by that act of physical isolation he signifies his spiritual
withdrawal for the time from all outward worldly ties and connexions
yes for replenished with the meat and wine of the word to the faithful
man of god this pulpit i see is a selfcontaining strongholda lofty
ehrenbreitstein with a perennial well of water within the walls

but the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place
borrowed from the chaplains former seafarings between the marble
cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed its back
was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating
against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy
breakers but high above the flying scud and darkrolling clouds there
floated a little isle of sunlight from which beamed forth an angels
face and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the
ships tossed deck something like that silver plate now inserted into
the victorys plank where nelson fell ah noble ship the angel
seemed to say beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardy
helm for lo the sun is breaking through the clouds are rolling
offserenest azure is at hand

nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same seataste that
had achieved the ladder and the picture its panelled front was in
the likeness of a ships bluff bows and the holy bible rested on a
projecting piece of scroll work fashioned after a ships fiddleheaded
beak

what could be more full of meaningfor the pulpit is ever this earths
foremost part all the rest comes in its rear the pulpit leads the
world from thence it is the storm of gods quick wrath is first
descried and the bow must bear the earliest brunt from thence it is
the god of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds
yes the worlds a ship on its passage out and not a voyage complete
and the pulpit is its prow



chapter 9 the sermon


father mapple rose and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered
the scattered people to condense starboard gangway there side away
to larboardlarboard gangway to starboard midships midships

there was a low rumbling of heavy seaboots among the benches and a
still slighter shuffling of womens shoes and all was quiet again and
every eye on the preacher

he paused a little then kneeling in the pulpits bows folded his large
brown hands across his chest uplifted his closed eyes and offered
a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the
bottom of the sea

this ended in prolonged solemn tones like the continual tolling of
a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fogin such tones he
commenced reading the following hymn but changing his manner towards
the concluding stanzas burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy

     the ribs and terrors in the whale
     arched over me a dismal gloom
     while all gods sunlit waves rolled by
     and lift me deepening down to doom

     i saw the opening maw of hell
     with endless pains and sorrows there
     which none but they that feel can tell
     oh i was plunging to despair

     in black distress i called my god
     when i could scarce believe him mine
     he bowed his ear to my complaints
     no more the whale did me confine

     with speed he flew to my relief
     as on a radiant dolphin borne
     awful yet bright as lightning shone
     the face of my deliverer god

     my song for ever shall record
     that terrible that joyful hour
     i give the glory to my god
     his all the mercy and the power


nearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above the
howling of the storm a brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turned
over the leaves of the bible and at last folding his hand down upon
the proper page said beloved shipmates clinch the last verse of the
first chapter of jonahand god had prepared a great fish to swallow up
jonah

shipmates this book containing only four chaptersfour yarnsis one
of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures yet what
depths of the soul does jonahs deep sealine sound what a pregnant
lesson to us is this prophet what a noble thing is that canticle in the
fishs belly how billowlike and boisterously grand we feel the floods
surging over us we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters
seaweed and all the slime of the sea is about us but what is this
lesson that the book of jonah teaches shipmates it is a twostranded
lesson a lesson to us all as sinful men and a lesson to me as a pilot
of the living god as sinful men it is a lesson to us all because it
is a story of the sin hardheartedness suddenly awakened fears the
swift punishment repentance prayers and finally the deliverance and
joy of jonah as with all sinners among men the sin of this son of
amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of godnever
mind now what that command was or how conveyedwhich he found a hard
command but all the things that god would have us do are hard for us to
doremember thatand hence he oftener commands us than endeavors to
persuade and if we obey god we must disobey ourselves and it is in
this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obeying god consists

with this sin of disobedience in him jonah still further flouts at
god by seeking to flee from him he thinks that a ship made by men will
carry him into countries where god does not reign but only the captains
of this earth he skulks about the wharves of joppa and seeks a ship
thats bound for tarshish there lurks perhaps a hitherto unheeded
meaning here by all accounts tarshish could have been no other city
than the modern cadiz thats the opinion of learned men and where is
cadiz shipmates cadiz is in spain as far by water from joppa
as jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days when the
atlantic was an almost unknown sea because joppa the modern jaffa
shipmates is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean the
syrian and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand miles to the
westward from that just outside the straits of gibraltar see ye
not then shipmates that jonah sought to flee worldwide from god
miserable man oh most contemptible and worthy of all scorn with
slouched hat and guilty eye skulking from his god prowling among the
shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas so disordered
selfcondemning is his look that had there been policemen in those
days jonah on the mere suspicion of something wrong had been arrested
ere he touched a deck how plainly hes a fugitive no baggage not a
hatbox valise or carpetbagno friends accompany him to the wharf
with their adieux at last after much dodging search he finds the
tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo and as he steps on
board to see its captain in the cabin all the sailors for the moment
desist from hoisting in the goods to mark the strangers evil eye
jonah sees this but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence
in vain essays his wretched smile strong intuitions of the man assure
the mariners he can be no innocent in their gamesome but still serious
way one whispers to the otherjack hes robbed a widow or joe
do you mark him hes a bigamist or harry lad i guess hes the
adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah or belike one of the missing
murderers from sodom another runs to read the bill thats stuck
against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored offering
five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide and
containing a description of his person he reads and looks from jonah
to the bill while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round jonah
prepared to lay their hands upon him frighted jonah trembles and
summoning all his boldness to his face only looks so much the more a
coward he will not confess himself suspected but that itself is strong
suspicion so he makes the best of it and when the sailors find him
not to be the man that is advertised they let him pass and he descends
into the cabin

whos there cries the captain at his busy desk hurriedly making
out his papers for the customswhos there oh how that harmless
question mangles jonah for the instant he almost turns to flee again
but he rallies i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon
sail ye sir thus far the busy captain had not looked up to jonah
though the man now stands before him but no sooner does he hear that
hollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing glance we sail with the
next coming tide at last he slowly answered still intently eyeing
him no sooner sirsoon enough for any honest man that goes a
passenger ha jonah thats another stab but he swiftly calls away
the captain from that scent ill sail with yehe saysthe
passage money how much is thatill pay now for it is particularly
written shipmates as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this
history that he paid the fare thereof ere the craft did sail and
taken with the context this is full of meaning

now jonahs captain shipmates was one whose discernment detects crime
in any but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless in this
world shipmates sin that pays its way can travel freely and without
a passport whereas virtue if a pauper is stopped at all frontiers
so jonahs captain prepares to test the length of jonahs purse ere he
judge him openly he charges him thrice the usual sum and its assented
to then the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive but at the same
time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold yet when
jonah fairly takes out his purse prudent suspicions still molest the
captain he rings every coin to find a counterfeit not a forger any
way he mutters and jonah is put down for his passage point out my
stateroom sir says jonah now im travelweary i need sleep
thou lookest like it says the captain theres thy room jonah
enters and would lock the door but the lock contains no key hearing
him foolishly fumbling there the captain laughs lowly to himself and
mutters something about the doors of convicts cells being never allowed
to be locked within all dressed and dusty as he is jonah throws
himself into his berth and finds the little stateroom ceiling almost
resting on his forehead the air is close and jonah gasps then in
that contracted hole sunk too beneath the ships waterline jonah
feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour when the whale
shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels wards

screwed at its axis against the side a swinging lamp slightly
oscillates in jonahs room and the ship heeling over towards the wharf
with the weight of the last bales received the lamp flame and all
though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquity with
reference to the room though in truth infallibly straight itself it
but made obvious the false lying levels among which it hung the lamp
alarms and frightens jonah as lying in his berth his tormented eyes
roll round the place and this thus far successful fugitive finds no
refuge for his restless glance but that contradiction in the lamp more
and more appals him the floor the ceiling and the side are all awry
oh so my conscience hangs in me he groans straight upwards so it
burns but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness

like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed still
reeling but with conscience yet pricking him as the plungings of the
roman racehorse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him as
one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish
praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed and at last amid
the whirl of woe he feels a deep stupor steals over him as over the
man who bleeds to death for conscience is the wound and theres naught
to staunch it so after sore wrestlings in his berth jonahs prodigy
of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep

and now the time of tide has come the ship casts off her cables and
from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish all careening
glides to sea that ship my friends was the first of recorded
smugglers the contraband was jonah but the sea rebels he will not
bear the wicked burden a dreadful storm comes on the ship is like to
break but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her
when boxes bales and jars are clattering overboard when the wind
is shrieking and the men are yelling and every plank thunders with
trampling feet right over jonahs head in all this raging tumult jonah
sleeps his hideous sleep he sees no black sky and raging sea feels not
the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the
mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after
him aye shipmates jonah was gone down into the sides of the shipa
berth in the cabin as i have taken it and was fast asleep but the
frightened master comes to him and shrieks in his dead ear what
meanest thou o sleeper arise startled from his lethargy by that
direful cry jonah staggers to his feet and stumbling to the deck
grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea but at that moment he is
sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks wave after
wave thus leaps into the ship and finding no speedy vent runs roaring
fore and aft till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat
and ever as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep
gullies in the blackness overhead aghast jonah sees the rearing
bowsprit pointing high upward but soon beat downward again towards the
tormented deep

terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul in all his cringing
attitudes the godfugitive is now too plainly known the sailors mark
him more and more certain grow their suspicions of him and at last
fully to test the truth by referring the whole matter to high heaven
they fall to casting lots to see for whose cause this great tempest was
upon them the lot is jonahs that discovered then how furiously they
mob him with their questions what is thine occupation whence comest
thou thy country what people but mark now my shipmates the behavior
of poor jonah the eager mariners but ask him who he is and where
from whereas they not only receive an answer to those questions
but likewise another answer to a question not put by them but the
unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hard hand of god that is
upon him

i am a hebrew he criesand theni fear the lord the god of heaven
who hath made the sea and the dry land fear him o jonah aye well
mightest thou fear the lord god then straightway he now goes on to
make a full confession whereupon the mariners became more and more
appalled but still are pitiful for when jonah not yet supplicating
god for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of his
desertswhen wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him
forth into the sea for he knew that for his sake this great tempest
was upon them they mercifully turn from him and seek by other means to
save the ship but all in vain the indignant gale howls louder
then with one hand raised invokingly to god with the other they not
unreluctantly lay hold of jonah

and now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea
when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east and the sea
is still as jonah carries down the gale with him leaving smooth
water behind he goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless
commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into
the yawning jaws awaiting him and the whale shootsto all his ivory
teeth like so many white bolts upon his prison then jonah prayed unto
the lord out of the fishs belly but observe his prayer and learn a
weighty lesson for sinful as he is jonah does not weep and wail for
direct deliverance he feels that his dreadful punishment is just he
leaves all his deliverance to god contenting himself with this that
spite of all his pains and pangs he will still look towards his holy
temple and here shipmates is true and faithful repentance not
clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment and how pleasing to
god was this conduct in jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance of
him from the sea and the whale shipmates i do not place jonah before
you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as a model
for repentance sin not but if you do take heed to repent of it like
jonah

while he was speaking these words the howling of the shrieking
slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher who
when describing jonahs seastorm seemed tossed by a storm himself
his deep chest heaved as with a groundswell his tossed arms seemed the
warring elements at work and the thunders that rolled away from off his
swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his simple
hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them

there now came a lull in his look as he silently turned over the leaves
of the book once more and at last standing motionless with closed
eyes for the moment seemed communing with god and himself

but again he leaned over towards the people and bowing his head lowly
with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility he spake these
words

shipmates god has laid but one hand upon you both his hands press
upon me i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that
jonah teaches to all sinners and therefore to ye and still more to me
for i am a greater sinner than ye and now how gladly would i come down
from this masthead and sit on the hatches there where you sit and
listen as you listen while some one of you reads me that other and more
awful lesson which jonah teaches to me as a pilot of the living god
how being an anointed pilotprophet or speaker of true things and
bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a
wicked nineveh jonah appalled at the hostility he should raise fled
from his mission and sought to escape his duty and his god by taking
ship at joppa but god is everywhere tarshish he never reached as we
have seen god came upon him in the whale and swallowed him down to
living gulfs of doom and with swift slantings tore him along into the
midst of the seas where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand
fathoms down and the weeds were wrapped about his head and all the
watery world of woe bowled over him yet even then beyond the reach of
any plummetout of the belly of hellwhen the whale grounded upon
the oceans utmost bones even then god heard the engulphed repenting
prophet when he cried then god spake unto the fish and from the
shuddering cold and blackness of the sea the whale came breeching
up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all the delights of air and
earth and vomited out jonah upon the dry land when the word of the
lord came a second time and jonah bruised and beatenhis ears like
two seashells still multitudinously murmuring of the oceanjonah
did the almightys bidding and what was that shipmates to preach the
truth to the face of falsehood that was it

this shipmates this is that other lesson and woe to that pilot of
the living god who slights it woe to him whom this world charms from
gospel duty woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when god
has brewed them into a gale woe to him who seeks to please rather than
to appal woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness woe
to him who in this world courts not dishonour woe to him who would
not be true even though to be false were salvation yea woe to him
who as the great pilot paul has it while preaching to others is
himself a castaway

he dropped and fell away from himself for a moment then lifting his
face to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried out with
a heavenly enthusiasmbut oh shipmates on the starboard hand of
every woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight
than the bottom of the woe is deep is not the maintruck higher than
the kelson is low delight is to hima far far upward and inward
delightwho against the proud gods and commodores of this earth ever
stands forth his own inexorable self delight is to him whose strong
arms yet support him when the ship of this base treacherous world has
gone down beneath him delight is to him who gives no quarter in the
truth and kills burns and destroys all sin though he pluck it out
from under the robes of senators and judges delighttopgallant
delight is to him who acknowledges no law or lord but the lord his
god and is only a patriot to heaven delight is to him whom all the
waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake
from this sure keel of the ages and eternal delight and deliciousness
will be his who coming to lay him down can say with his final
breatho fatherchiefly known to me by thy rodmortal or immortal
here i die i have striven to be thine more than to be this worlds or
mine own yet this is nothing i leave eternity to thee for what is man
that he should live out the lifetime of his god

he said no more but slowly waving a benediction covered his face with
his hands and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed
and he was left alone in the place



chapter 10 a bosom friend


returning to the spouterinn from the chapel i found queequeg there
quite alone he having left the chapel before the benediction some time
he was sitting on a bench before the fire with his feet on the stove
hearth and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little
negro idol of his peering hard into its face and with a jackknife
gently whittling away at its nose meanwhile humming to himself in his
heathenish way

but being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon going
to the table took up a large book there and placing it on his lap
began counting the pages with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth
pageas i fanciedstopping a moment looking vacantly around him and
giving utterance to a longdrawn gurgling whistle of astonishment he
would then begin again at the next fifty seeming to commence at number
one each time as though he could not count more than fifty and it was
only by such a large number of fifties being found together that his
astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited

with much interest i sat watching him savage though he was and
hideously marred about the faceat least to my tastehis countenance
yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable you cannot
hide the soul through all his unearthly tattooings i thought i saw
the traces of a simple honest heart and in his large deep eyes
fiery black and bold there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a
thousand devils and besides all this there was a certain lofty bearing
about the pagan which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim
he looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor
whether it was too that his head being shaved his forehead was drawn
out in freer and brighter relief and looked more expansive than it
otherwise would this i will not venture to decide but certain it was
his head was phrenologically an excellent one it may seem ridiculous
but it reminded me of general washingtons head as seen in the popular
busts of him it had the same long regularly graded retreating slope
from above the brows which were likewise very projecting like two
long promontories thickly wooded on top queequeg was george washington
cannibalistically developed

whilst i was thus closely scanning him halfpretending meanwhile to be
looking out at the storm from the casement he never heeded my presence
never troubled himself with so much as a single glance but appeared
wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book
considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night
previous and especially considering the affectionate arm i had found
thrown over me upon waking in the morning i thought this indifference
of his very strange but savages are strange beings at times you do not
know exactly how to take them at first they are overawing their calm
selfcollectedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom i had noticed
also that queequeg never consorted at all or but very little with the
other seamen in the inn he made no advances whatever appeared to have
no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances all this struck
me as mighty singular yet upon second thoughts there was something
almost sublime in it here was a man some twenty thousand miles from
home by the way of cape horn that iswhich was the only way he could
get therethrown among people as strange to him as though he were in
the planet jupiter and yet he seemed entirely at his ease preserving
the utmost serenity content with his own companionship always equal to
himself surely this was a touch of fine philosophy though no doubt he
had never heard there was such a thing as that but perhaps to be
true philosophers we mortals should not be conscious of so living or
so striving so soon as i hear that such or such a man gives himself
out for a philosopher i conclude that like the dyspeptic old woman he
must have broken his digester

as i sat there in that now lonely room the fire burning low in that
mild stage when after its first intensity has warmed the air it then
only glows to be looked at the evening shades and phantoms gathering
round the casements and peering in upon us silent solitary twain
the storm booming without in solemn swells i began to be sensible of
strange feelings i felt a melting in me no more my splintered heart
and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world this soothing
savage had redeemed it there he sat his very indifference speaking a
nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits
wild he was a very sight of sights to see yet i began to feel myself
mysteriously drawn towards him and those same things that would have
repelled most others they were the very magnets that thus drew me ill
try a pagan friend thought i since christian kindness has proved but
hollow courtesy i drew my bench near him and made some friendly signs
and hints doing my best to talk with him meanwhile at first he little
noticed these advances but presently upon my referring to his last
nights hospitalities he made out to ask me whether we were again to be
bedfellows i told him yes whereat i thought he looked pleased perhaps
a little complimented

we then turned over the book together and i endeavored to explain to
him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few pictures
that were in it thus i soon engaged his interest and from that we went
to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen
in this famous town soon i proposed a social smoke and producing
his pouch and tomahawk he quietly offered me a puff and then we sat
exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his and keeping it regularly
passing between us

if there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the pagans
breast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out and left
us cronies he seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as
i to him and when our smoke was over he pressed his forehead against
mine clasped me round the waist and said that henceforth we were
married meaning in his countrys phrase that we were bosom friends
he would gladly die for me if need should be in a countryman this
sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature a thing
to be much distrusted but in this simple savage those old rules would
not apply

after supper and another social chat and smoke we went to our room
together he made me a present of his embalmed head took out his
enormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out
some thirty dollars in silver then spreading them on the table and
mechanically dividing them into two equal portions pushed one of them
towards me and said it was mine i was going to remonstrate but he
silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers pockets i let them stay
he then went about his evening prayers took out his idol and removed
the paper fireboard by certain signs and symptoms i thought he seemed
anxious for me to join him but well knowing what was to follow i
deliberated a moment whether in case he invited me i would comply or
otherwise

i was a good christian born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
presbyterian church how then could i unite with this wild idolator in
worshipping his piece of wood but what is worship thought i do
you suppose now ishmael that the magnanimous god of heaven and
earthpagans and all includedcan possibly be jealous of an
insignificant bit of black wood impossible but what is worshipto do
the will of godthat is worship and what is the will of godto do to
my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to methat is the
will of god now queequeg is my fellow man and what do i wish that
this queequeg would do to me why unite with me in my particular
presbyterian form of worship consequently i must then unite with him
in his ergo i must turn idolator so i kindled the shavings helped
prop up the innocent little idol offered him burnt biscuit with
queequeg salamed before him twice or thrice kissed his nose and that
done we undressed and went to bed at peace with our own consciences
and all the world but we did not go to sleep without some little chat

how it is i know not but there is no place like a bed for confidential
disclosures between friends man and wife they say there open the very
bottom of their souls to each other and some old couples often lie
and chat over old times till nearly morning thus then in our hearts
honeymoon lay i and queequega cosy loving pair



chapter 11 nightgown


we had lain thus in bed chatting and napping at short intervals and
queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs
over mine and then drawing them back so entirely sociable and free
and easy were we when at last by reason of our confabulations what
little nappishness remained in us altogether departed and we felt like
getting up again though daybreak was yet some way down the future

yes we became very wakeful so much so that our recumbent position
began to grow wearisome and by little and little we found ourselves
sitting up the clothes well tucked around us leaning against the
headboard with our four knees drawn up close together and our two
noses bending over them as if our kneepans were warmingpans we felt
very nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out of doors
indeed out of bedclothes too seeing that there was no fire in the
room the more so i say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some
small part of you must be cold for there is no quality in this world
that is not what it is merely by contrast nothing exists in itself if
you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable and have been so
a long time then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more but if
like queequeg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crown
of your head be slightly chilled why then indeed in the general
consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm for this
reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire which
is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich for the height of this
sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and
your snugness and the cold of the outer air then there you lie like the
one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal

we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time when all at
once i thought i would open my eyes for when between sheets whether
by day or by night and whether asleep or awake i have a way of always
keeping my eyes shut in order the more to concentrate the snugness
of being in bed because no man can ever feel his own identity aright
except his eyes be closed as if darkness were indeed the proper element
of our essences though light be more congenial to our clayey part upon
opening my eyes then and coming out of my own pleasant and selfcreated
darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated
twelveoclockatnight i experienced a disagreeable revulsion nor did
i at all object to the hint from queequeg that perhaps it were best to
strike a light seeing that we were so wide awake and besides he felt
a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his tomahawk be it said
that though i had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the
bed the night before yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when
love once comes to bend them for now i liked nothing better than to
have queequeg smoking by me even in bed because he seemed to be full
of such serene household joy then i no more felt unduly concerned for
the landlords policy of insurance i was only alive to the condensed
confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real
friend with our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders we now passed
the tomahawk from one to the other till slowly there grew over us a
blue hanging tester of smoke illuminated by the flame of the newlit
lamp

whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far
distant scenes i know not but he now spoke of his native island and
eager to hear his history i begged him to go on and tell it he gladly
complied though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few of his
words yet subsequent disclosures when i had become more familiar with
his broken phraseology now enable me to present the whole story such as
it may prove in the mere skeleton i give



chapter 12 biographical


queequeg was a native of rokovoko an island far away to the west and
south it is not down in any map true places never are

when a newhatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in
a grass clout followed by the nibbling goats as if he were a green
sapling even then in queequegs ambitious soul lurked a strong desire
to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two his
father was a high chief a king his uncle a high priest and on the
maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable
warriors there was excellent blood in his veinsroyal stuff though
sadly vitiated i fear by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his
untutored youth

a sag harbor ship visited his fathers bay and queequeg sought a
passage to christian lands but the ship having her full complement of
seamen spurned his suit and not all the king his fathers influence
could prevail but queequeg vowed a vow alone in his canoe he paddled
off to a distant strait which he knew the ship must pass through when
she quitted the island on one side was a coral reef on the other a low
tongue of land covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the
water hiding his canoe still afloat among these thickets with its
prow seaward he sat down in the stern paddle low in hand and when the
ship was gliding by like a flash he darted out gained her side with
one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe climbed up
the chains and throwing himself at full length upon the deck grappled
a ringbolt there and swore not to let it go though hacked in pieces

in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard suspended a
cutlass over his naked wrists queequeg was the son of a king and
queequeg budged not struck by his desperate dauntlessness and his wild
desire to visit christendom the captain at last relented and told
him he might make himself at home but this fine young savagethis sea
prince of wales never saw the captains cabin they put him down among
the sailors and made a whaleman of him but like czar peter content to
toil in the shipyards of foreign cities queequeg disdained no seeming
ignominy if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his
untutored countrymen for at bottomso he told mehe was actuated by a
profound desire to learn among the christians the arts whereby to
make his people still happier than they were and more than that
still better than they were but alas the practices of whalemen soon
convinced him that even christians could be both miserable and wicked
infinitely more so than all his fathers heathens arrived at last in
old sag harbor and seeing what the sailors did there and then going on
to nantucket and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also
poor queequeg gave it up for lost thought he its a wicked world in
all meridians ill die a pagan

and thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among these christians
wore their clothes and tried to talk their gibberish hence the queer
ways about him though now some time from home

by hints i asked him whether he did not propose going back and having
a coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone he
being very old and feeble at the last accounts he answered no not yet
and added that he was fearful christianity or rather christians had
unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan
kings before him but by and by he said he would returnas soon as
he felt himself baptized again for the nonce however he proposed to
sail about and sow his wild oats in all four oceans they had made a
harpooneer of him and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now

i asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching his future
movements he answered to go to sea again in his old vocation upon
this i told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of my
intention to sail out of nantucket as being the most promising port for
an adventurous whaleman to embark from he at once resolved to accompany
me to that island ship aboard the same vessel get into the same watch
the same boat the same mess with me in short to share my every hap
with both my hands in his boldly dip into the potluck of both worlds
to all this i joyously assented for besides the affection i now felt
for queequeg he was an experienced harpooneer and as such could not
fail to be of great usefulness to one who like me was wholly ignorant
of the mysteries of whaling though well acquainted with the sea as
known to merchant seamen

his story being ended with his pipes last dying puff queequeg embraced
me pressed his forehead against mine and blowing out the light we
rolled over from each other this way and that and very soon were
sleeping


chapter 13 wheelbarrow


next morning monday after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber
for a block i settled my own and comrades bill using however my
comrades money the grinning landlord as well as the boarders seemed
amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between
me and queequegespecially as peter coffins cock and bull stories
about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person
whom i now companied with

we borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our things including my own
poor carpetbag and queequegs canvas sack and hammock away we went
down to the moss the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the
wharf as we were going along the people stared not at queequeg
so muchfor they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their
streetsbut at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms but we
heeded them not going along wheeling the barrow by turns and queequeg
now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs i asked
him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore and
whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons to this in
substance he replied that though what i hinted was true enough yet
he had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it was of
assured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate
with the hearts of whales in short like many inland reapers
and mowers who go into the farmers meadows armed with their own
scythesthough in no wise obliged to furnish themeven so queequeg
for his own private reasons preferred his own harpoon

shifting the barrow from my hand to his he told me a funny story about
the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen it was in sag harbor the owners
of his ship it seems had lent him one in which to carry his
heavy chest to his boarding house not to seem ignorant about the
thingthough in truth he was entirely so concerning the precise way in
which to manage the barrowqueequeg puts his chest upon it lashes it
fast and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf why
said i queequeg you might have known better than that one would
think didnt the people laugh

upon this he told me another story the people of his island of
rokovoko it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water
of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and
this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided
mat where the feast is held now a certain grand merchant ship once
touched at rokovoko and its commanderfrom all accounts a very
stately punctilious gentleman at least for a sea captainthis
commander was invited to the wedding feast of queequegs sister a
pretty young princess just turned of ten well when all the wedding
guests were assembled at the brides bamboo cottage this captain
marches in and being assigned the post of honour placed himself over
against the punchbowl and between the high priest and his majesty the
king queequegs father grace being saidfor those people have their
grace as well as wethough queequeg told me that unlike us who at such
times look downwards to our platters they on the contrary copying the
ducks glance upwards to the great giver of all feastsgrace i say
being said the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony
of the island that is dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers
into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates seeing himself
placed next the priest and noting the ceremony and thinking
himselfbeing captain of a shipas having plain precedence over a
mere island king especially in the kings own housethe captain coolly
proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowltaking it i suppose for a
huge fingerglass now said queequeg what you tink nowdidnt our
people laugh

at last passage paid and luggage safe we stood on board the schooner
hoisting sail it glided down the acushnet river on one side new
bedford rose in terraces of streets their icecovered trees all
glittering in the clear cold air huge hills and mountains of casks on
casks were piled upon her wharves and side by side the worldwandering
whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last while from others
came a sound of carpenters and coopers with blended noises of fires and
forges to melt the pitch all betokening that new cruises were on the
start that one most perilous and long voyage ended only begins a
second and a second ended only begins a third and so on for ever
and for aye such is the endlessness yea the intolerableness of all
earthly effort

gaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh the little
moss tossed the quick foam from her bows as a young colt his snortings
how i snuffed that tartar airhow i spurned that turnpike earththat
common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and
hoofs and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will
permit no records

at the same foamfountain queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me
his dusky nostrils swelled apart he showed his filed and pointed teeth
on on we flew and our offing gained the moss did homage to the
blast ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan sideways
leaning we sideways darted every ropeyarn tingling like a wire the
two tall masts buckling like indian canes in land tornadoes so full of
this reeling scene were we as we stood by the plunging bowsprit that
for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers a
lubberlike assembly who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so
companionable as though a white man were anything more dignified than a
whitewashed negro but there were some boobies and bumpkins there who
by their intense greenness must have come from the heart and centre of
all verdure queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him
behind his back i thought the bumpkins hour of doom was come dropping
his harpoon the brawny savage caught him in his arms and by an almost
miraculous dexterity and strength sent him high up bodily into the air
then slightly tapping his stern in midsomerset the fellow landed with
bursting lungs upon his feet while queequeg turning his back upon him
lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff

capting capting yelled the bumpkin running towards that officer
capting capting heres the devil

hallo you sir cried the captain a gaunt rib of the sea stalking
up to queequeg what in thunder do you mean by that dont you know you
might have killed that chap

what him say said queequeg as he mildly turned to me

he say said i that you came near kille that man there pointing
to the still shivering greenhorn

kille cried queequeg twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly
expression of disdain ah him bevy smalle fishe queequeg no kille
so smalle fishe queequeg kille big whale

look you roared the captain ill kille you you cannibal if you
try any more of your tricks aboard here so mind your eye

but it so happened just then that it was high time for the captain to
mind his own eye the prodigious strain upon the mainsail had parted
the weathersheet and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to
side completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck the poor
fellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly was swept overboard all
hands were in a panic and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it
seemed madness it flew from right to left and back again almost
in one ticking of a watch and every instant seemed on the point of
snapping into splinters nothing was done and nothing seemed capable of
being done those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eyeing the
boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale in the
midst of this consternation queequeg dropped deftly to his knees and
crawling under the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope secured one
end to the bulwarks and then flinging the other like a lasso caught it
round the boom as it swept over his head and at the next jerk the spar
was that way trapped and all was safe the schooner was run into the
wind and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat queequeg
stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long living arc of
a leap for three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog
throwing his long arms straight out before him and by turns revealing
his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam i looked at the grand
and glorious fellow but saw no one to be saved the greenhorn had gone
down shooting himself perpendicularly from the water queequeg now
took an instants glance around him and seeming to see just how matters
were dived down and disappeared a few minutes more and he rose again
one arm still striking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form
the boat soon picked them up the poor bumpkin was restored all hands
voted queequeg a noble trump the captain begged his pardon from that
hour i clove to queequeg like a barnacle yea till poor queequeg took
his last long dive

was there ever such unconsciousness he did not seem to think that he at
all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies he only
asked for waterfresh watersomething to wipe the brine off that
done he put on dry clothes lighted his pipe and leaning against the
bulwarks and mildly eyeing those around him seemed to be saying
to himselfits a mutual jointstock world in all meridians we
cannibals must help these christians



chapter 14 nantucket


nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning so after a
fine run we safely arrived in nantucket

nantucket take out your map and look at it see what a real corner of
the world it occupies how it stands there away off shore more lonely
than the eddystone lighthouse look at ita mere hillock and elbow of
sand all beach without a background there is more sand there than
you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper some
gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there they
dont grow naturally that they import canada thistles that they have
to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that
pieces of wood in nantucket are carried about like bits of the true
cross in rome that people there plant toadstools before their houses
to get under the shade in summer time that one blade of grass makes an
oasis three blades in a days walk a prairie that they wear quicksand
shoes something like laplander snowshoes that they are so shut up
belted about every way inclosed surrounded and made an utter island
of by the ocean that to their very chairs and tables small clams will
sometimes be found adhering as to the backs of sea turtles but these
extravaganzas only show that nantucket is no illinois

look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was
settled by the redmen thus goes the legend in olden times an eagle
swooped down upon the new england coast and carried off an infant
indian in his talons with loud lament the parents saw their child borne
out of sight over the wide waters they resolved to follow in the same
direction setting out in their canoes after a perilous passage they
discovered the island and there they found an empty ivory casketthe
poor little indians skeleton

what wonder then that these nantucketers born on a beach should take
to the sea for a livelihood they first caught crabs and quohogs in
the sand grown bolder they waded out with nets for mackerel more
experienced they pushed off in boats and captured cod and at last
launching a navy of great ships on the sea explored this watery world
put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it peeped in
at behrings straits and in all seasons and all oceans declared
everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the
flood most monstrous and most mountainous that himmalehan saltsea
mastodon clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power that
his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and
malicious assaults

and thus have these naked nantucketers these sea hermits issuing from
their anthill in the sea overrun and conquered the watery world like
so many alexanders parcelling out among them the atlantic pacific and
indian oceans as the three pirate powers did poland let america add
mexico to texas and pile cuba upon canada let the english overswarm
all india and hang out their blazing banner from the sun two thirds
of this terraqueous globe are the nantucketers for the sea is his he
owns it as emperors own empires other seamen having but a right of
way through it merchant ships are but extension bridges armed ones but
floating forts even pirates and privateers though following the sea
as highwaymen the road they but plunder other ships other fragments of
the land like themselves without seeking to draw their living from the
bottomless deep itself the nantucketer he alone resides and riots on
the sea he alone in bible language goes down to it in ships to and
fro ploughing it as his own special plantation there is his home there
lies his business which a noahs flood would not interrupt though it
overwhelmed all the millions in china he lives on the sea as prairie
cocks in the prairie he hides among the waves he climbs them as
chamois hunters climb the alps for years he knows not the land so
that when he comes to it at last it smells like another world more
strangely than the moon would to an earthsman with the landless gull
that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows
so at nightfall the nantucketer out of sight of land furls his sails
and lays him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herds of
walruses and whales



chapter 15 chowder


it was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly
to anchor and queequeg and i went ashore so we could attend to no
business that day at least none but a supper and a bed the landlord of
the spouterinn had recommended us to his cousin hosea hussey of the
try pots whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept
hotels in all nantucket and moreover he had assured us that cousin
hosea as he called him was famous for his chowders in short he
plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try potluck at
the try pots but the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow
warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the
larboard and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a
corner three points to the starboard and that done then ask the first
man we met where the place was these crooked directions of his very
much puzzled us at first especially as at the outset queequeg
insisted that the yellow warehouseour first point of departuremust
be left on the larboard hand whereas i had understood peter coffin to
say it was on the starboard however by dint of beating about a little
in the dark and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant
to inquire the way we at last came to something which there was no
mistaking

two enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by asses ears
swung from the crosstrees of an old topmast planted in front of an
old doorway the horns of the crosstrees were sawed off on the other
side so that this old topmast looked not a little like a gallows
perhaps i was over sensitive to such impressions at the time but i
could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving a sort of
crick was in my neck as i gazed up to the two remaining horns yes two
of them one for queequeg and one for me its ominous thinks i a
coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port tombstones
staring at me in the whalemens chapel and here a gallows and a pair
of prodigious black pots too are these last throwing out oblique hints
touching tophet

i was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman
with yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the inn
under a dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injured
eye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen
shirt

get along with ye said she to the man or ill be combing ye

come on queequeg said i all right theres mrs hussey

and so it turned out mr hosea hussey being from home but leaving
mrs hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs upon
making known our desires for a supper and a bed mrs hussey postponing
further scolding for the present ushered us into a little room and
seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded
repast turned round to us and saidclam or cod

whats that about cods maam said i with much politeness

clam or cod she repeated

a clam for supper a cold clam is that what you mean mrs hussey
says i but thats a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter
time aint it mrs hussey

but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple
shirt who was waiting for it in the entry and seeming to hear nothing
but the word clam mrs hussey hurried towards an open door leading to
the kitchen and bawling out clam for two disappeared

queequeg said i do you think that we can make out a supper for us
both on one clam

however a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the
apparently cheerless prospect before us but when that smoking chowder
came in the mystery was delightfully explained oh sweet friends
hearken to me it was made of small juicy clams scarcely bigger than
hazel nuts mixed with pounded ship biscuit and salted pork cut up into
little flakes the whole enriched with butter and plentifully seasoned
with pepper and salt our appetites being sharpened by the frosty
voyage and in particular queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food
before him and the chowder being surpassingly excellent we despatched
it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and bethinking
me of mrs husseys clam and cod announcement i thought i would try
a little experiment stepping to the kitchen door i uttered the word
cod with great emphasis and resumed my seat in a few moments the
savoury steam came forth again but with a different flavor and in good
time a fine codchowder was placed before us

we resumed business and while plying our spoons in the bowl thinks i
to myself i wonder now if this here has any effect on the head
whats that stultifying saying about chowderheaded people but look
queequeg aint that a live eel in your bowl wheres your harpoon

fishiest of all fishy places was the try pots which well deserved
its name for the pots there were always boiling chowders chowder for
breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper till you
began to look for fishbones coming through your clothes the area
before the house was paved with clamshells mrs hussey wore a polished
necklace of codfish vertebra and hosea hussey had his account books
bound in superior old sharkskin there was a fishy flavor to the milk
too which i could not at all account for till one morning happening
to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermens boats i saw
hoseas brindled cow feeding on fish remnants and marching along the
sand with each foot in a cods decapitated head looking very slipshod
i assure ye

supper concluded we received a lamp and directions from mrs hussey
concerning the nearest way to bed but as queequeg was about to precede
me up the stairs the lady reached forth her arm and demanded his
harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chambers why not said i
every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoonbut why not because
its dangerous says she ever since young stiggs coming from that
unfortnt vyge of his when he was gone four years and a half with
only three barrels of ile was found dead in my first floor back with
his harpoon in his side ever since then i allow no boarders to take
sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night so mr queequeg for
she had learned his name i will just take this here iron and keep
it for you till morning but the chowder clam or cod tomorrow for
breakfast men

both says i and lets have a couple of smoked herring by way of
variety



chapter 16 the ship


in bed we concocted our plans for the morrow but to my surprise and
no small concern queequeg now gave me to understand that he had been
diligently consulting yojothe name of his black little godand yojo
had told him two or three times over and strongly insisted upon it
everyway that instead of our going together among the whalingfleet in
harbor and in concert selecting our craft instead of this i say yojo
earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly
with me inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us and in order to
do so had already pitched upon a vessel which if left to myself i
ishmael should infallibly light upon for all the world as though it
had turned out by chance and in that vessel i must immediately ship
myself for the present irrespective of queequeg

i have forgotten to mention that in many things queequeg placed great
confidence in the excellence of yojos judgment and surprising forecast
of things and cherished yojo with considerable esteem as a rather good
sort of god who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole but in all
cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs

now this plan of queequegs or rather yojos touching the selection
of our craft i did not like that plan at all i had not a little relied
upon queequegs sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry
us and our fortunes securely but as all my remonstrances produced
no effect upon queequeg i was obliged to acquiesce and accordingly
prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort
of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that trifling little
affair next morning early leaving queequeg shut up with yojo in our
little bedroomfor it seemed that it was some sort of lent or ramadan
or day of fasting humiliation and prayer with queequeg and yojo that
day how it was i never could find out for though i applied myself
to it several times i never could master his liturgies and xxxix
articlesleaving queequeg then fasting on his tomahawk pipe and yojo
warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings i sallied out among
the shipping after much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries
i learnt that there were three ships up for threeyears voyagesthe
devildam the titbit and the pequod devildam i do not know the
origin of titbit is obvious pequod you will no doubt remember was
the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians now extinct
as the ancient medes i peered and pryed about the devildam from her
hopped over to the titbit and finally going on board the pequod
looked around her for a moment and then decided that this was the very
ship for us

you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught i
knowsquaretoed luggers mountainous japanese junks butterbox
galliots and what not but take my word for it you never saw such a
rare old craft as this same rare old pequod she was a ship of the old
school rather small if anything with an oldfashioned clawfooted look
about her long seasoned and weatherstained in the typhoons and calms
of all four oceans her old hulls complexion was darkened like a french
grenadiers who has alike fought in egypt and siberia her venerable
bows looked bearded her mastscut somewhere on the coast of japan
where her original ones were lost overboard in a galeher masts stood
stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of cologne her
ancient decks were worn and wrinkled like the pilgrimworshipped
flagstone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled but to all these
her old antiquities were added new and marvellous features pertaining
to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed
old captain peleg many years her chiefmate before he commanded
another vessel of his own and now a retired seaman and one of the
principal owners of the pequodthis old peleg during the term of his
chiefmateship had built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaid
it all over with a quaintness both of material and device unmatched
by anything except it be thorkillhakes carved buckler or bedstead she
was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor his neck heavy with
pendants of polished ivory she was a thing of trophies a cannibal of
a craft tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies all
round her unpanelled open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous
jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale inserted there for
pins to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to those thews ran not
through base blocks of land wood but deftly travelled over sheaves of
seaivory scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm she sported
there a tiller and that tiller was in one mass curiously carved
from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe the helmsman who
steered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the tartar when he holds
back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw a noble craft but somehow a
most melancholy all noble things are touched with that

now when i looked about the quarterdeck for some one having authority
in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage at first i saw
nobody but i could not well overlook a strange sort of tent or
rather wigwam pitched a little behind the mainmast it seemed only
a temporary erection used in port it was of a conical shape some ten
feet high consisting of the long huge slabs of limber black bone taken
from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the rightwhale
planted with their broad ends on the deck a circle of these slabs laced
together mutually sloped towards each other and at the apex united in
a tufted point where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the
topknot on some old pottowottamie sachems head a triangular opening
faced towards the bows of the ship so that the insider commanded a
complete view forward

and half concealed in this queer tenement i at length found one who
by his aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon and
the ships work suspended was now enjoying respite from the burden of
command he was seated on an oldfashioned oaken chair wriggling all
over with curious carving and the bottom of which was formed of a
stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was
constructed

there was nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance of
the elderly man i saw he was brown and brawny like most old seamen
and heavily rolled up in blue pilotcloth cut in the quaker style
only there was a fine and almost microscopic network of the minutest
wrinkles interlacing round his eyes which must have arisen from
his continual sailings in many hard gales and always looking to
windwardfor this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed
together such eyewrinkles are very effectual in a scowl

is this the captain of the pequod said i advancing to the door of
the tent

supposing it be the captain of the pequod what dost thou want of him
he demanded

i was thinking of shipping

thou wast wast thou i see thou art no nantucketerever been in a
stove boat

no sir i never have

dost know nothing at all about whaling i dare sayeh

nothing sir but i have no doubt i shall soon learn ive been several
voyages in the merchant service and i think that

merchant service be damned talk not that lingo to me dost see that
legill take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou talkest of
the marchant service to me again marchant service indeed i suppose now
ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships
but flukes man what makes thee want to go a whaling ehit looks
a little suspicious dont it ehhast not been a pirate hast
thoudidst not rob thy last captain didst thoudost not think of
murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea

i protested my innocence of these things i saw that under the mask
of these half humorous innuendoes this old seaman as an insulated
quakerish nantucketer was full of his insular prejudices and rather
distrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from cape cod or the
vineyard

but what takes thee awhaling i want to know that before i think of
shipping ye

well sir i want to see what whaling is i want to see the world

want to see what whaling is eh have ye clapped eye on captain ahab

who is captain ahab sir

aye aye i thought so captain ahab is the captain of this ship

i am mistaken then i thought i was speaking to the captain himself

thou art speaking to captain pelegthats who ye are speaking to
young man it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fitted
out for the voyage and supplied with all her needs including crew we
are part owners and agents but as i was going to say if thou wantest
to know what whaling is as thou tellest ye do i can put ye in a way of
finding it out before ye bind yourself to it past backing out clap
eye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that he has only one
leg

what do you mean sir was the other one lost by a whale

lost by a whale young man come nearer to me it was devoured
chewed up crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a
boatah ah

i was a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touched at
the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said as calmly as i
could what you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could i know
there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed
i might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident

look ye now young man thy lungs are a sort of soft dye see thou
dost not talk shark a bit sure yeve been to sea before now sure of
that

sir said i i thought i told you that i had been four voyages in the
merchant

hard down out of that mind what i said about the marchant
servicedont aggravate mei wont have it but let us understand each
other i have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feel
inclined for it

i do sir

very good now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whales
throat and then jump after it answer quick

i am sir if it should be positively indispensable to do so not to be
got rid of that is which i dont take to be the fact

good again now then thou not only wantest to go awhaling to find
out by experience what whaling is but ye also want to go in order to
see the world was not that what ye said i thought so well then just
step forward there and take a peep over the weatherbow and then back
to me and tell me what ye see there

for a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request not
knowing exactly how to take it whether humorously or in earnest but
concentrating all his crows feet into one scowl captain peleg started
me on the errand

going forward and glancing over the weather bow i perceived that the
ship swinging to her anchor with the floodtide was now obliquely
pointing towards the open ocean the prospect was unlimited but
exceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slightest variety that i
could see

well whats the report said peleg when i came back what did ye
see

not much i repliednothing but water considerable horizon though
and theres a squall coming up i think

well what does thou think then of seeing the world do ye wish to go
round cape horn to see any more of it eh cant ye see the world where
you stand

i was a little staggered but go awhaling i must and i would and the
pequod was as good a ship as anyi thought the bestand all this i now
repeated to peleg seeing me so determined he expressed his willingness
to ship me

and thou mayest as well sign the papers right off he addedcome
along with ye and so saying he led the way below deck into the cabin

seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and
surprising figure it turned out to be captain bildad who along with
captain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel the other
shares as is sometimes the case in these ports being held by a crowd
of old annuitants widows fatherless children and chancery wards each
owning about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail
or two in the ship people in nantucket invest their money in whaling
vessels the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks
bringing in good interest

now bildad like peleg and indeed many other nantucketers was a
quaker the island having been originally settled by that sect and to
this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the
peculiarities of the quaker only variously and anomalously modified
by things altogether alien and heterogeneous for some of these same
quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whalehunters they
are fighting quakers they are quakers with a vengeance

so that there are instances among them of men who named with scripture
namesa singularly common fashion on the islandand in childhood
naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker
idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless adventure
of their subsequent lives strangely blend with these unoutgrown
peculiarities a thousand bold dashes of character not unworthy a
scandinavian seaking or a poetical pagan roman and when these things
unite in a man of greatly superior natural force with a globular brain
and a ponderous heart who has also by the stillness and seclusion
of many long nightwatches in the remotest waters and beneath
constellations never seen here at the north been led to think
untraditionally and independently receiving all natures sweet or
savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding
breast and thereby chiefly but with some help from accidental
advantages to learn a bold and nervous lofty languagethat man makes
one in a whole nations censusa mighty pageant creature formed for
noble tragedies nor will it at all detract from him dramatically
regarded if either by birth or other circumstances he have what seems
a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature for all
men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness be sure
of this o young ambition all mortal greatness is but disease but
as yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite another and
still a man who if indeed peculiar it only results again from another
phase of the quaker modified by individual circumstances

like captain peleg captain bildad was a welltodo retired whaleman
but unlike captain pelegwho cared not a rush for what are called
serious things and indeed deemed those selfsame serious things the
veriest of all triflescaptain bildad had not only been originally
educated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism but all
his subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovely island
creatures round the hornall that had not moved this native born
quaker one single jot had not so much as altered one angle of his
vest still for all this immutableness was there some lack of
common consistency about worthy captain peleg though refusing from
conscientious scruples to bear arms against land invaders yet himself
had illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific and though a sworn foe
to human bloodshed yet had he in his straightbodied coat spilled tuns
upon tuns of leviathan gore how now in the contemplative evening of his
days the pious bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence i do
not know but it did not seem to concern him much and very probably
he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a mans
religion is one thing and this practical world quite another this
world pays dividends rising from a little cabinboy in short clothes
of the drabbest drab to a harpooneer in a broad shadbellied waistcoat
from that becoming boatheader chiefmate and captain and finally a
ship owner bildad as i hinted before had concluded his adventurous
career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of
sixty and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his
wellearned income

now bildad i am sorry to say had the reputation of being an
incorrigible old hunks and in his seagoing days a bitter hard
taskmaster they told me in nantucket though it certainly seems a
curious story that when he sailed the old categut whaleman his crew
upon arriving home were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital sore
exhausted and worn out for a pious man especially for a quaker he was
certainly rather hardhearted to say the least he never used to swear
though at his men they said but somehow he got an inordinate
quantity of cruel unmitigated hard work out of them when bildad was a
chiefmate to have his drabcoloured eye intently looking at you made
you feel completely nervous till you could clutch somethinga hammer
or a marlingspike and go to work like mad at something or other
never mind what indolence and idleness perished before him his own
person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character on his
long gaunt body he carried no spare flesh no superfluous beard
his chin having a soft economical nap to it like the worn nap of his
broadbrimmed hat

such then was the person that i saw seated on the transom when i
followed captain peleg down into the cabin the space between the decks
was small and there boltupright sat old bildad who always sat so
and never leaned and this to save his coat tails his broadbrim was
placed beside him his legs were stiffly crossed his drab vesture was
buttoned up to his chin and spectacles on nose he seemed absorbed in
reading from a ponderous volume

bildad cried captain peleg at it again bildad eh ye have been
studying those scriptures now for the last thirty years to my certain
knowledge how far ye got bildad

as if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate
bildad without noticing his present irreverence quietly looked up and
seeing me glanced again inquiringly towards peleg

he says hes our man bildad said peleg he wants to ship

dost thee said bildad in a hollow tone and turning round to me

i dost said i unconsciously he was so intense a quaker

what do ye think of him bildad said peleg

hell do said bildad eyeing me and then went on spelling away at
his book in a mumbling tone quite audible

i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw especially as peleg
his friend and old shipmate seemed such a blusterer but i said
nothing only looking round me sharply peleg now threw open a chest
and drawing forth the ships articles placed pen and ink before him
and seated himself at a little table i began to think it was high time
to settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage for the
voyage i was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no
wages but all hands including the captain received certain shares of
the profits called lays and that these lays were proportioned to the
degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ships
company i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling my own
lay would not be very large but considering that i was used to the sea
could steer a ship splice a rope and all that i made no doubt that
from all i had heard i should be offered at least the 275th laythat
is the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage whatever
that might eventually amount to and though the 275th lay was what they
call a rather long lay yet it was better than nothing and if we had a
lucky voyage might pretty nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out
on it not to speak of my three years beef and board for which i would
not have to pay one stiver

it might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely
fortuneand so it was a very poor way indeed but i am one of those
that never take on about princely fortunes and am quite content if the
world is ready to board and lodge me while i am putting up at this grim
sign of the thunder cloud upon the whole i thought that the 275th lay
would be about the fair thing but would not have been surprised had i
been offered the 200th considering i was of a broadshouldered make

but one thing nevertheless that made me a little distrustful about
receiving a generous share of the profits was this ashore i had heard
something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad
how that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod therefore
the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners left nearly the
whole management of the ships affairs to these two and i did not know
but what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say about
shipping hands especially as i now found him on board the pequod
quite at home there in the cabin and reading his bible as if at his
own fireside now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his
jackknife old bildad to my no small surprise considering that he was
such an interested party in these proceedings bildad never heeded
us but went on mumbling to himself out of his book lay not up for
yourselves treasures upon earth where moth

well captain bildad interrupted peleg what dye say what lay
shall we give this young man

thou knowest best was the sepulchral reply the seven hundred and
seventyseventh wouldnt be too much would itwhere moth and rust do
corrupt but lay

lay indeed thought i and such a lay the seven hundred and
seventyseventh well old bildad you are determined that i for one
shall not lay up many lays here below where moth and rust do corrupt
it was an exceedingly long lay that indeed and though from the
magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman yet
the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and
seventyseven is a pretty large number yet when you come to make
a teenth of it you will then see i say that the seven hundred and
seventyseventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven
hundred and seventyseven gold doubloons and so i thought at the time

why blast your eyes bildad cried peleg thou dost not want to
swindle this young man he must have more than that

seven hundred and seventyseventh again said bildad without lifting
his eyes and then went on mumblingfor where your treasure is there
will your heart be also

i am going to put him down for the three hundredth said peleg do ye
hear that bildad the three hundredth lay i say

bildad laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him said
captain peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider the
duty thou owest to the other owners of this shipwidows and orphans
many of themand that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this
young man we may be taking the bread from those widows and those
orphans the seven hundred and seventyseventh lay captain peleg

thou bildad roared peleg starting up and clattering about the
cabin blast ye captain bildad if i had followed thy advice in these
matters i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be
heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape
horn

captain peleg said bildad steadily thy conscience may be drawing
ten inches of water or ten fathoms i cant tell but as thou art still
an impenitent man captain peleg i greatly fear lest thy conscience be
but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the
fiery pit captain peleg

fiery pit fiery pit ye insult me man past all natural bearing ye
insult me its an allfired outrage to tell any human creature that
hes bound to hell flukes and flames bildad say that again to me and
start my soulbolts but illillyes ill swallow a live goat with
all his hair and horns on out of the cabin ye canting drabcoloured
son of a wooden guna straight wake with ye

as he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad but with a marvellous
oblique sliding celerity bildad for that time eluded him

alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and
responsible owners of the ship and feeling half a mind to give up
all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily
commanded i stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad who
i made no doubt was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened
wrath of peleg but to my astonishment he sat down again on the
transom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest intention of
withdrawing he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways as
for peleg after letting off his rage as he had there seemed no more
left in him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitched a
little as if still nervously agitated whew he whistled at lastthe
squalls gone off to leeward i think bildad thou used to be good at
sharpening a lance mend that pen will ye my jackknife here needs
the grindstone thats he thank ye bildad now then my young man
ishmaels thy name didnt ye say well then down ye go here ishmael
for the three hundredth lay

captain peleg said i i have a friend with me who wants to ship
tooshall i bring him down tomorrow

to be sure said peleg fetch him along and well look at him

what lay does he want groaned bildad glancing up from the book in
which he had again been burying himself

oh never thee mind about that bildad said peleg has he ever
whaled it any turning to me

killed more whales than i can count captain peleg

well bring him along then

and after signing the papers off i went nothing doubting but that i
had done a good mornings work and that the pequod was the identical
ship that yojo had provided to carry queequeg and me round the cape

but i had not proceeded far when i began to bethink me that the captain
with whom i was to sail yet remained unseen by me though indeed in
many cases a whaleship will be completely fitted out and receive all
her crew on board ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving
to take command for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged and the
shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief that if the captain have
a family or any absorbing concernment of that sort he does not trouble
himself much about his ship in port but leaves her to the owners till
all is ready for sea however it is always as well to have a look at
him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands turning back
i accosted captain peleg inquiring where captain ahab was to be found

and what dost thou want of captain ahab its all right enough thou
art shipped

yes but i should like to see him

but i dont think thou wilt be able to at present i dont know exactly
whats the matter with him but he keeps close inside the house a sort
of sick and yet he dont look so in fact he aint sick but no he
isnt well either any how young man he wont always see me so i
dont suppose he will thee hes a queer man captain ahabso some
thinkbut a good one oh thoult like him well enough no fear no
fear hes a grand ungodly godlike man captain ahab doesnt speak
much but when he does speak then you may well listen mark ye be
forewarned ahabs above the common ahabs been in colleges as well as
mong the cannibals been used to deeper wonders than the waves fixed
his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes than whales his lance
aye the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle oh he aint
captain bildad no and he aint captain peleg hes ahab boy and ahab
of old thou knowest was a crowned king

and a very vile one when that wicked king was slain the dogs did
they not lick his blood

come hither to mehither hither said peleg with a significance in
his eye that almost startled me look ye lad never say that on board
the pequod never say it anywhere captain ahab did not name himself
twas a foolish ignorant whim of his crazy widowed mother who died
when he was only a twelvemonth old and yet the old squaw tistig at
gayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophetic and perhaps
other fools like her may tell thee the same i wish to warn thee its a
lie i know captain ahab well ive sailed with him as mate years ago
i know what he isa good mannot a pious good man like bildad but
a swearing good mansomething like meonly theres a good deal more of
him aye aye i know that he was never very jolly and i know that on
the passage home he was a little out of his mind for a spell but it
was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that
about as any one might see i know too that ever since he lost
his leg last voyage by that accursed whale hes been a kind of
moodydesperate moody and savage sometimes but that will all pass
off and once for all let me tell thee and assure thee young man its
better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one so
goodbye to theeand wrong not captain ahab because he happens to
have a wicked name besides my boy he has a wifenot three voyages
weddeda sweet resigned girl think of that by that sweet girl that
old man has a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless
harm in ahab no no my lad stricken blasted if he be ahab has his
humanities

as i walked away i was full of thoughtfulness what had been
incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab filled me with a certain
wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him and somehow at the time
i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for i dont know what
unless it was the cruel loss of his leg and yet i also felt a strange
awe of him but that sort of awe which i cannot at all describe was
not exactly awe i do not know what it was but i felt it and it did
not disincline me towards him though i felt impatience at what seemed
like mystery in him so imperfectly as he was known to me then however
my thoughts were at length carried in other directions so that for the
present dark ahab slipped my mind



chapter 17 the ramadan


as queequegs ramadan or fasting and humiliation was to continue all
day i did not choose to disturb him till towards nightfall for i
cherish the greatest respect towards everybodys religious obligations
never mind how comical and could not find it in my heart to undervalue
even a congregation of ants worshipping a toadstool or those other
creatures in certain parts of our earth who with a degree of footmanism
quite unprecedented in other planets bow down before the torso of
a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate
possessions yet owned and rented in his name

i say we good presbyterian christians should be charitable in these
things and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals
pagans and what not because of their halfcrazy conceits on these
subjects there was queequeg now certainly entertaining the most
absurd notions about yojo and his ramadanbut what of that queequeg
thought he knew what he was about i suppose he seemed to be content
and there let him rest all our arguing with him would not avail let
him be i say and heaven have mercy on us allpresbyterians and pagans
alikefor we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head and
sadly need mending

towards evening when i felt assured that all his performances and
rituals must be over i went up to his room and knocked at the door but
no answer i tried to open it but it was fastened inside queequeg
said i softly through the keyholeall silent i say queequeg why
dont you speak its iishmael but all remained still as before i
began to grow alarmed i had allowed him such abundant time i thought
he might have had an apoplectic fit i looked through the keyhole but
the door opening into an odd corner of the room the keyhole prospect
was but a crooked and sinister one i could only see part of the
footboard of the bed and a line of the wall but nothing more i
was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of
queequegs harpoon which the landlady the evening previous had taken
from him before our mounting to the chamber thats strange thought i
but at any rate since the harpoon stands yonder and he seldom or
never goes abroad without it therefore he must be inside here and no
possible mistake

queequegqueequegall still something must have happened
apoplexy i tried to burst open the door but it stubbornly resisted
running down stairs i quickly stated my suspicions to the first person
i metthe chambermaid la la she cried i thought something must
be the matter i went to make the bed after breakfast and the door was
locked and not a mouse to be heard and its been just so silent ever
since but i thought may be you had both gone off and locked your
baggage in for safe keeping la la maammistress murder mrs
hussey apoplexyand with these cries she ran towards the kitchen i
following

mrs hussey soon appeared with a mustardpot in one hand and a
vinegarcruet in the other having just broken away from the occupation
of attending to the castors and scolding her little black boy meantime

woodhouse cried i which way to it run for gods sake and fetch
something to pry open the doorthe axethe axe hes had a stroke
depend upon itand so saying i was unmethodically rushing up stairs
again emptyhanded when mrs hussey interposed the mustardpot and
vinegarcruet and the entire castor of her countenance

whats the matter with you young man

get the axe for gods sake run for the doctor some one while i pry
it open

look here said the landlady quickly putting down the vinegarcruet
so as to have one hand free look here are you talking about prying
open any of my doorsand with that she seized my arm whats the
matter with you whats the matter with you shipmate

in as calm but rapid a manner as possible i gave her to understand the
whole case unconsciously clapping the vinegarcruet to one side of her
nose she ruminated for an instant then exclaimedno i havent seen
it since i put it there running to a little closet under the landing
of the stairs she glanced in and returning told me that queequegs
harpoon was missing hes killed himself she cried its unfortnate
stiggs done over again there goes another counterpanegod pity his poor
motherit will be the ruin of my house has the poor lad a sister
wheres that girlthere betty go to snarles the painter and tell
him to paint me a sign withno suicides permitted here and no
smoking in the parlormight as well kill both birds at once kill
the lord be merciful to his ghost whats that noise there you young
man avast there

and running up after me she caught me as i was again trying to force
open the door

i dont allow it i wont have my premises spoiled go for the
locksmith theres one about a mile from here but avast putting her
hand in her sidepocket heres a key thatll fit i guess lets
see and with that she turned it in the lock but alas queequegs
supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within

have to burst it open said i and was running down the entry a
little for a good start when the landlady caught at me again vowing
i should not break down her premises but i tore from her and with a
sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark

with a prodigious noise the door flew open and the knob slamming
against the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling and there good
heavens there sat queequeg altogether cool and selfcollected right
in the middle of the room squatting on his hams and holding yojo on
top of his head he looked neither one way nor the other way but sat
like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life

queequeg said i going up to him queequeg whats the matter with
you

he haint been a sittin so all day has he said the landlady

but all we said not a word could we drag out of him i almost felt
like pushing him over so as to change his position for it was almost
intolerable it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained
especially as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of
eight or ten hours going too without his regular meals

mrs hussey said i hes alive at all events so leave us if you
please and i will see to this strange affair myself

closing the door upon the landlady i endeavored to prevail upon
queequeg to take a chair but in vain there he sat and all he could
dofor all my polite arts and blandishmentshe would not move a peg
nor say a single word nor even look at me nor notice my presence in
the slightest way

i wonder thought i if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan do
they fast on their hams that way in his native island it must be so
yes its part of his creed i suppose well then let him rest hell
get up sooner or later no doubt it cant last for ever thank god
and his ramadan only comes once a year and i dont believe its very
punctual then

i went down to supper after sitting a long time listening to the long
stories of some sailors who had just come from a plumpudding voyage as
they called it that is a short whalingvoyage in a schooner or brig
confined to the north of the line in the atlantic ocean only after
listening to these plumpuddingers till nearly eleven oclock i went
up stairs to go to bed feeling quite sure by this time queequeg must
certainly have brought his ramadan to a termination but no there he
was just where i had left him he had not stirred an inch i began to
grow vexed with him it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be
sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room
holding a piece of wood on his head

for heavens sake queequeg get up and shake yourself get up and have
some supper youll starve youll kill yourself queequeg but not a
word did he reply

despairing of him therefore i determined to go to bed and to sleep
and no doubt before a great while he would follow me but previous to
turning in i took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it over him as
it promised to be a very cold night and he had nothing but his ordinary
round jacket on for some time do all i would i could not get into
the faintest doze i had blown out the candle and the mere thought
of queequegnot four feet offsitting there in that uneasy position
stark alone in the cold and dark this made me really wretched think of
it sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his
hams in this dreary unaccountable ramadan

but somehow i dropped off at last and knew nothing more till break of
day when looking over the bedside there squatted queequeg as if he
had been screwed down to the floor but as soon as the first glimpse of
sun entered the window up he got with stiff and grating joints
but with a cheerful look limped towards me where i lay pressed his
forehead again against mine and said his ramadan was over

now as i before hinted i have no objection to any persons religion
be it what it may so long as that person does not kill or insult any
other person because that other person dont believe it also but when
a mans religion becomes really frantic when it is a positive torment
to him and in fine makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to
lodge in then i think it high time to take that individual aside and
argue the point with him

and just so i now did with queequeg queequeg said i get into bed
now and lie and listen to me i then went on beginning with the rise
and progress of the primitive religions and coming down to the various
religions of the present time during which time i labored to show
queequeg that all these lents ramadans and prolonged hamsquattings in
cold cheerless rooms were stark nonsense bad for the health useless
for the soul opposed in short to the obvious laws of hygiene and
common sense i told him too that he being in other things such an
extremely sensible and sagacious savage it pained me very badly pained
me to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous ramadan
of his besides argued i fasting makes the body cave in hence the
spirit caves in and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be
halfstarved this is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish
such melancholy notions about their hereafters in one word queequeg
said i rather digressively hell is an idea first born on an undigested
appledumpling and since then perpetuated through the hereditary
dyspepsias nurtured by ramadans

i then asked queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with
dyspepsia expressing the idea very plainly so that he could take it
in he said no only upon one memorable occasion it was after a great
feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle
wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two oclock in the
afternoon and all cooked and eaten that very evening

no more queequeg said i shuddering that will do for i knew the
inferences without his further hinting them i had seen a sailor who had
visited that very island and he told me that it was the custom when
a great battle had been gained there to barbecue all the slain in the
yard or garden of the victor and then one by one they were placed
in great wooden trenchers and garnished round like a pilau with
breadfruit and cocoanuts and with some parsley in their mouths were
sent round with the victors compliments to all his friends just as
though these presents were so many christmas turkeys

after all i do not think that my remarks about religion made much
impression upon queequeg because in the first place he somehow seemed
dull of hearing on that important subject unless considered from his
own point of view and in the second place he did not more than one
third understand me couch my ideas simply as i would and finally he
no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than
i did he looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and
compassion as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible
young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety

at last we rose and dressed and queequeg taking a prodigiously hearty
breakfast of chowders of all sorts so that the landlady should not
make much profit by reason of his ramadan we sallied out to board the
pequod sauntering along and picking our teeth with halibut bones



chapter 18 his mark


as we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship queequeg
carrying his harpoon captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us
from his wigwam saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal
and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft
unless they previously produced their papers

what do you mean by that captain peleg said i now jumping on the
bulwarks and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf

i mean he replied he must show his papers

yes said captain bildad in his hollow voice sticking his head from
behind pelegs out of the wigwam he must show that hes converted
son of darkness he added turning to queequeg art thou at present in
communion with any christian church

why said i hes a member of the first congregational church here
be it said that many tattooed savages sailing in nantucket ships at
last come to be converted into the churches

first congregational church cried bildad what that worships in
deacon deuteronomy colemans meetinghouse and so saying taking
out his spectacles he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana
handkerchief and putting them on very carefully came out of the
wigwam and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks took a good long look at
queequeg

how long hath he been a member he then said turning to me not very
long i rather guess young man

no said peleg and he hasnt been baptized right either or it would
have washed some of that devils blue off his face

do tell now cried bildad is this philistine a regular member of
deacon deuteronomys meeting i never saw him going there and i pass it
every lords day

i dont know anything about deacon deuteronomy or his meeting said
i all i know is that queequeg here is a born member of the first
congregational church he is a deacon himself queequeg is

young man said bildad sternly thou art skylarking with meexplain
thyself thou young hittite what church dost thee mean answer me

finding myself thus hard pushed i replied i mean sir the same
ancient catholic church to which you and i and captain peleg there
and queequeg here and all of us and every mothers son and soul of
us belong the great and everlasting first congregation of this whole
worshipping world we all belong to that only some of us cherish some
queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief in that we all join
hands

splice thou meanst splice hands cried peleg drawing nearer young
man youd better ship for a missionary instead of a foremast hand
i never heard a better sermon deacon deuteronomywhy father mapple
himself couldnt beat it and hes reckoned something come aboard come
aboard never mind about the papers i say tell quohog therewhats
that you call him tell quohog to step along by the great anchor what
a harpoon hes got there looks like good stuff that and he handles it
about right i say quohog or whatever your name is did you ever stand
in the head of a whaleboat did you ever strike a fish

without saying a word queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped upon
the bulwarks from thence into the bows of one of the whaleboats
hanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and poising his
harpoon cried out in some such way as this

capain you see him small drop tar on water dere you see him well
spose him one whale eye well den and taking sharp aim at it he
darted the iron right over old bildads broad brim clean across the
ships decks and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight

now said queequeg quietly hauling in the line sposee him whalee
eye why dad whale dead

quick bildad said peleg his partner who aghast at the close
vicinity of the flying harpoon had retreated towards the cabin gangway
quick i say you bildad and get the ships papers we must have
hedgehog there i mean quohog in one of our boats look ye quohog
well give ye the ninetieth lay and thats more than ever was given a
harpooneer yet out of nantucket

so down we went into the cabin and to my great joy queequeg was soon
enrolled among the same ships company to which i myself belonged

when all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready for
signing he turned to me and said i guess quohog there dont know how
to write does he i say quohog blast ye dost thou sign thy name or
make thy mark

but at this question queequeg who had twice or thrice before taken
part in similar ceremonies looked no ways abashed but taking the
offered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an exact
counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm so
that through captain pelegs obstinate mistake touching his appellative
it stood something like this

quohog his x mark

meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg
and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his
broadskirted drab coat took out a bundle of tracts and selecting
one entitled the latter day coming or no time to lose placed it in
queequegs hands and then grasping them and the book with both his
looked earnestly into his eyes and said son of darkness i must do my
duty by thee i am part owner of this ship and feel concerned for the
souls of all its crew if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways which i
sadly fear i beseech thee remain not for aye a belial bondsman spurn
the idol bell and the hideous dragon turn from the wrath to come mind
thine eye i say oh goodness gracious steer clear of the fiery pit

something of the salt sea yet lingered in old bildads language
heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases

avast there avast there bildad avast now spoiling our harpooneer
peleg pious harpooneers never make good voyagersit takes the shark
out of em no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish
there was young nat swaine once the bravest boatheader out of all
nantucket and the vineyard he joined the meeting and never came to
good he got so frightened about his plaguy soul that he shrinked and
sheered away from whales for fear of afterclaps in case he got stove
and went to davy jones

peleg peleg said bildad lifting his eyes and hands thou thyself
as i myself hast seen many a perilous time thou knowest peleg what
it is to have the fear of death how then canst thou prate in this
ungodly guise thou beliest thine own heart peleg tell me when this
same pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on japan
that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab didst thou not
think of death and the judgment then

hear him hear him now cried peleg marching across the cabin and
thrusting his hands far down into his pocketshear him all of ye
think of that when every moment we thought the ship would sink
death and the judgment then what with all three masts making such an
everlasting thundering against the side and every sea breaking over us
fore and aft think of death and the judgment then no no time to think
about death then life was what captain ahab and i was thinking of
and how to save all handshow to rig jurymastshow to get into the
nearest port that was what i was thinking of

bildad said no more but buttoning up his coat stalked on deck
where we followed him there he stood very quietly overlooking some
sailmakers who were mending a topsail in the waist now and then
he stooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine which
otherwise might have been wasted



chapter 19 the prophet


shipmates have ye shipped in that ship

queequeg and i had just left the pequod and were sauntering away from
the water for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts when
the above words were put to us by a stranger who pausing before us
levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question he was but
shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers a rag of a
black handkerchief investing his neck a confluent smallpox had in all
directions flowed over his face and left it like the complicated ribbed
bed of a torrent when the rushing waters have been dried up

have ye shipped in her he repeated

you mean the ship pequod i suppose said i trying to gain a little
more time for an uninterrupted look at him

aye the pequodthat ship there he said drawing back his whole
arm and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him with the fixed
bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object

yes said i we have just signed the articles

anything down there about your souls

about what

oh perhaps you havnt got any he said quickly no matter though
i know many chaps that havnt got anygood luck to em and they are
all the better off for it a souls a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon

what are you jabbering about shipmate said i

hes got enough though to make up for all deficiencies of that sort
in other chaps abruptly said the stranger placing a nervous emphasis
upon the word he

queequeg said i lets go this fellow has broken loose from
somewhere hes talking about something and somebody we dont know

stop cried the stranger ye said trueye havnt seen old thunder
yet have ye

whos old thunder said i again riveted with the insane earnestness
of his manner

captain ahab

what the captain of our ship the pequod

aye among some of us old sailor chaps he goes by that name ye
havnt seen him yet have ye

no we havnt hes sick they say but is getting better and will be
all right again before long

all right again before long laughed the stranger with a solemnly
derisive sort of laugh look ye when captain ahab is all right then
this left arm of mine will be all right not before

what do you know about him

what did they tell you about him say that

they didnt tell much of anything about him only ive heard that hes
a good whalehunter and a good captain to his crew

thats true thats trueyes both true enough but you must jump when
he gives an order step and growl growl and gothats the word with
captain ahab but nothing about that thing that happened to him off cape
horn long ago when he lay like dead for three days and nights
nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the spaniard afore the altar in
santaheard nothing about that eh nothing about the silver calabash
he spat into and nothing about his losing his leg last voyage
according to the prophecy didnt ye hear a word about them matters and
something more eh no i dont think ye did how could ye who knows
it not all nantucket i guess but howsever mayhap yeve heard tell
about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard of that i dare
say oh yes that every one knows amosti mean they know hes only one
leg and that a parmacetti took the other off

my friend said i what all this gibberish of yours is about i
dont know and i dont much care for it seems to me that you must be a
little damaged in the head but if you are speaking of captain ahab of
that ship there the pequod then let me tell you that i know all about
the loss of his leg

all about it ehsure you doall

pretty sure

with finger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod the beggarlike
stranger stood a moment as if in a troubled reverie then starting a
little turned and saidyeve shipped have ye names down on the
papers well well whats signed is signed and whats to be will be
and then again perhaps it wont be after all anyhow its all fixed
and arranged aready and some sailors or other must go with him i
suppose as well these as any other men god pity em morning to ye
shipmates morning the ineffable heavens bless ye im sorry i stopped
ye

look here friend said i if you have anything important to tell
us out with it but if you are only trying to bamboozle us you are
mistaken in your game thats all i have to say

and its said very well and i like to hear a chap talk up that way
you are just the man for himthe likes of ye morning to ye shipmates
morning oh when ye get there tell em ive concluded not to make one
of em

ah my dear fellow you cant fool us that wayyou cant fool us it
is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great
secret in him

morning to ye shipmates morning

morning it is said i come along queequeg lets leave this crazy
man but stop tell me your name will you

elijah

elijah thought i and we walked away both commenting after each
others fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that he was
nothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear but we had not gone
perhaps above a hundred yards when chancing to turn a corner and
looking back as i did so who should be seen but elijah following us
though at a distance somehow the sight of him struck me so that i
said nothing to queequeg of his being behind but passed on with my
comrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner
that we did he did and then it seemed to me that he was dogging
us but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine this
circumstance coupled with his ambiguous halfhinting halfrevealing
shrouded sort of talk now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments
and halfapprehensions and all connected with the pequod and captain
ahab and the leg he had lost and the cape horn fit and the silver
calabash and what captain peleg had said of him when i left the ship
the day previous and the prediction of the squaw tistig and the voyage
we had bound ourselves to sail and a hundred other shadowy things

i was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah was really
dogging us or not and with that intent crossed the way with queequeg
and on that side of it retraced our steps but elijah passed on without
seeming to notice us this relieved me and once more and finally as it
seemed to me i pronounced him in my heart a humbug



chapter 20 all astir


a day or two passed and there was great activity aboard the pequod
not only were the old sails being mended but new sails were coming on
board and bolts of canvas and coils of rigging in short everything
betokened that the ships preparations were hurrying to a close captain
peleg seldom or never went ashore but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp
lookout upon the hands bildad did all the purchasing and providing
at the stores and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were
working till long after nightfall

on the day following queequegs signing the articles word was given at
all the inns where the ships company were stopping that their chests
must be on board before night for there was no telling how soon
the vessel might be sailing so queequeg and i got down our traps
resolving however to sleep ashore till the last but it seems they
always give very long notice in these cases and the ship did not sail
for several days but no wonder there was a good deal to be done and
there is no telling how many things to be thought of before the pequod
was fully equipped

every one knows what a multitude of thingsbeds saucepans knives
and forks shovels and tongs napkins nutcrackers and what not are
indispensable to the business of housekeeping just so with whaling
which necessitates a threeyears housekeeping upon the wide ocean
far from all grocers costermongers doctors bakers and bankers and
though this also holds true of merchant vessels yet not by any means
to the same extent as with whalemen for besides the great length of the
whaling voyage the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the
fishery and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors
usually frequented it must be remembered that of all ships whaling
vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds and especially
to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of
the voyage most depends hence the spare boats spare spars and spare
lines and harpoons and spare everythings almost but a spare captain
and duplicate ship

at the period of our arrival at the island the heaviest storage of the
pequod had been almost completed comprising her beef bread water
fuel and iron hoops and staves but as before hinted for some time
there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and
ends of things both large and small

chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was captain
bildads sister a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable
spirit but withal very kindhearted who seemed resolved that if she
could help it nothing should be found wanting in the pequod after once
fairly getting to sea at one time she would come on board with a jar
of pickles for the stewards pantry another time with a bunch of quills
for the chief mates desk where he kept his log a third time with a
roll of flannel for the small of some ones rheumatic back never did
any woman better deserve her name which was charityaunt charity as
everybody called her and like a sister of charity did this charitable
aunt charity bustle about hither and thither ready to turn her hand
and heart to anything that promised to yield safety comfort and
consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother
bildad was concerned and in which she herself owned a score or two of
wellsaved dollars

but it was startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress coming on
board as she did the last day with a long oilladle in one hand and
a still longer whaling lance in the other nor was bildad himself nor
captain peleg at all backward as for bildad he carried about with him
a long list of the articles needed and at every fresh arrival down
went his mark opposite that article upon the paper every once in a
while peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den roaring at the men
down the hatchways roaring up to the riggers at the masthead and then
concluded by roaring back into his wigwam

during these days of preparation queequeg and i often visited the
craft and as often i asked about captain ahab and how he was and when
he was going to come on board his ship to these questions they would
answer that he was getting better and better and was expected aboard
every day meantime the two captains peleg and bildad could attend
to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage if i had been
downright honest with myself i would have seen very plainly in my heart
that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage
without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute
dictator of it so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea
but when a man suspects any wrong it sometimes happens that if he be
already involved in the matter he insensibly strives to cover up his
suspicions even from himself and much this way it was with me i said
nothing and tried to think nothing

at last it was given out that some time next day the ship would
certainly sail so next morning queequeg and i took a very early start



chapter 21 going aboard


it was nearly six oclock but only grey imperfect misty dawn when we
drew nigh the wharf

there are some sailors running ahead there if i see right said i to
queequeg it cant be shadows shes off by sunrise i guess come on

avast cried a voice whose owner at the same time coming close behind
us laid a hand upon both our shoulders and then insinuating himself
between us stood stooping forward a little in the uncertain twilight
strangely peering from queequeg to me it was elijah

going aboard

hands off will you said i

lookee here said queequeg shaking himself go way

aint going aboard then

yes we are said i but what business is that of yours do you know
mr elijah that i consider you a little impertinent

no no no i wasnt aware of that said elijah slowly and
wonderingly looking from me to queequeg with the most unaccountable
glances

elijah said i you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing we
are going to the indian and pacific oceans and would prefer not to be
detained

ye be be ye coming back afore breakfast

hes cracked queequeg said i come on

holloa cried stationary elijah hailing us when we had removed a few
paces

never mind him said i queequeg come on

but he stole up to us again and suddenly clapping his hand on my
shoulder saiddid ye see anything looking like men going towards that
ship a while ago

struck by this plain matteroffact question i answered saying yes
i thought i did see four or five men but it was too dim to be sure

very dim very dim said elijah morning to ye

once more we quitted him but once more he came softly after us and
touching my shoulder again said see if you can find em now will ye

find who

morning to ye morning to ye he rejoined again moving off oh i
was going to warn ye againstbut never mind never mindits all one
all in the family toosharp frost this morning aint it goodbye to
ye shant see ye again very soon i guess unless its before the grand
jury and with these cracked words he finally departed leaving me for
the moment in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence

at last stepping on board the pequod we found everything in profound
quiet not a soul moving the cabin entrance was locked within the
hatches were all on and lumbered with coils of rigging going forward
to the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttle open seeing a
light we went down and found only an old rigger there wrapped in a
tattered peajacket he was thrown at whole length upon two chests his
face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms the profoundest slumber
slept upon him

those sailors we saw queequeg where can they have gone to said i
looking dubiously at the sleeper but it seemed that when on the wharf
queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to hence i would
have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter
were it not for elijahs otherwise inexplicable question but i beat the
thing down and again marking the sleeper jocularly hinted to queequeg
that perhaps we had best sit up with the body telling him to establish
himself accordingly he put his hand upon the sleepers rear as though
feeling if it was soft enough and then without more ado sat quietly
down there

gracious queequeg dont sit there said i

oh perry dood seat said queequeg my country way wont hurt him
face

face said i call that his face very benevolent countenance then
but how hard he breathes hes heaving himself get off queequeg you
are heavy its grinding the face of the poor get off queequeg look
hell twitch you off soon i wonder he dont wake

queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper and
lighted his tomahawk pipe i sat at the feet we kept the pipe passing
over the sleeper from one to the other meanwhile upon questioning him
in his broken fashion queequeg gave me to understand that in his
land owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts the king
chiefs and great people generally were in the custom of fattening some
of the lower orders for ottomans and to furnish a house comfortably in
that respect you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows and lay
them round in the piers and alcoves besides it was very convenient on
an excursion much better than those gardenchairs which are convertible
into walkingsticks upon occasion a chief calling his attendant and
desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree perhaps
in some damp marshy place

while narrating these things every time queequeg received the tomahawk
from me he flourished the hatchetside of it over the sleepers head

whats that for queequeg

perry easy kille oh perry easy

he was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawkpipe
which it seemed had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed
his soul when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger the
strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole it began
to tell upon him he breathed with a sort of muffledness then seemed
troubled in the nose then revolved over once or twice then sat up and
rubbed his eyes

holloa he breathed at last who be ye smokers

shipped men answered i when does she sail

aye aye ye are going in her be ye she sails today the captain
came aboard last night

what captainahab

who but him indeed

i was going to ask him some further questions concerning ahab when we
heard a noise on deck

holloa starbucks astir said the rigger hes a lively chief mate
that good man and a pious but all alive now i must turn to and so
saying he went on deck and we followed

it was now clear sunrise soon the crew came on board in twos and
threes the riggers bestirred themselves the mates were actively
engaged and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various
last things on board meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly
enshrined within his cabin



chapter 22 merry christmas


at length towards noon upon the final dismissal of the ships riggers
and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf and after the
everthoughtful charity had come off in a whaleboat with her last
gifta nightcap for stubb the second mate her brotherinlaw and a
spare bible for the stewardafter all this the two captains peleg
and bildad issued from the cabin and turning to the chief mate peleg
said

now mr starbuck are you sure everything is right captain ahab is
all readyjust spoke to himnothing more to be got from shore eh
well call all hands then muster em aft hereblast em

no need of profane words however great the hurry peleg said bildad
but away with thee friend starbuck and do our bidding

how now here upon the very point of starting for the voyage captain
peleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on the
quarterdeck just as if they were to be jointcommanders at sea as
well as to all appearances in port and as for captain ahab no sign of
him was yet to be seen only they said he was in the cabin but then
the idea was that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the
ship under weigh and steering her well out to sea indeed as that was
not at all his proper business but the pilots and as he was not
yet completely recoveredso they saidtherefore captain ahab stayed
below and all this seemed natural enough especially as in the merchant
service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable
time after heaving up the anchor but remain over the cabin table
having a farewell merrymaking with their shore friends before they
quit the ship for good with the pilot

but there was not much chance to think over the matter for captain
peleg was now all alive he seemed to do most of the talking and
commanding and not bildad

aft here ye sons of bachelors he cried as the sailors lingered at
the mainmast mr starbuck driveem aft

strike the tent therewas the next order as i hinted before this
whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port and on board the
pequod for thirty years the order to strike the tent was well known to
be the next thing to heaving up the anchor

man the capstan blood and thunderjumpwas the next command and
the crew sprang for the handspikes

now in getting under weigh the station generally occupied by the pilot
is the forward part of the ship and here bildad who with peleg be it
known in addition to his other officers was one of the licensed pilots
of the porthe being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in
order to save the nantucket pilotfee to all the ships he was concerned
in for he never piloted any other craftbildad i say might now
be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching
anchor and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody
to cheer the hands at the windlass who roared forth some sort of
a chorus about the girls in booble alley with hearty good will
nevertheless not three days previous bildad had told them that no
profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod particularly in
getting under weigh and charity his sister had placed a small choice
copy of watts in each seamans berth

meantime overseeing the other part of the ship captain peleg ripped
and swore astern in the most frightful manner i almost thought he would
sink the ship before the anchor could be got up involuntarily i paused
on my handspike and told queequeg to do the same thinking of the
perils we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a
pilot i was comforting myself however with the thought that in pious
bildad might be found some salvation spite of his seven hundred and
seventyseventh lay when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear and
turning round was horrified at the apparition of captain peleg in the
act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity that was my first
kick

is that the way they heave in the marchant service he roared
spring thou sheephead spring and break thy backbone why dont ye
spring i say all of yespring quohog spring thou chap with the red
whiskers spring there scotchcap spring thou green pants spring i
say all of ye and spring your eyes out and so saying he moved
along the windlass here and there using his leg very freely while
imperturbable bildad kept leading off with his psalmody thinks i
captain peleg must have been drinking something today

at last the anchor was up the sails were set and off we glided it
was a short cold christmas and as the short northern day merged into
night we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose
freezing spray cased us in ice as in polished armor the long rows of
teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight and like the white
ivory tusks of some huge elephant vast curving icicles depended from
the bows

lank bildad as pilot headed the first watch and ever and anon as the
old craft deep dived into the green seas and sent the shivering frost
all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang his steady
notes were heard

sweet fields beyond the swelling flood stand dressed in living green
so to the jews old canaan stood while jordan rolled between


never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then they
were full of hope and fruition spite of this frigid winter night in the
boisterous atlantic spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket there was
yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store and meads
and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by the spring
untrodden unwilted remains at midsummer

at last we gained such an offing that the two pilots were needed
no longer the stout sailboat that had accompanied us began ranging
alongside

it was curious and not unpleasing how peleg and bildad were affected at
this juncture especially captain bildad for loath to depart yet
very loath to leave for good a ship bound on so long and perilous a
voyagebeyond both stormy capes a ship in which some thousands of
his hard earned dollars were invested a ship in which an old shipmate
sailed as captain a man almost as old as he once more starting to
encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw loath to say goodbye to
a thing so every way brimful of every interest to himpoor old bildad
lingered long paced the deck with anxious strides ran down into the
cabin to speak another farewell word there again came on deck and
looked to windward looked towards the wide and endless waters only
bounded by the faroff unseen eastern continents looked towards
the land looked aloft looked right and left looked everywhere
and nowhere and at last mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin
convulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand and holding up a lantern
for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face as much as to say
nevertheless friend peleg i can stand it yes i can

as for peleg himself he took it more like a philosopher but for all
his philosophy there was a tear twinkling in his eye when the lantern
came too near and he too did not a little run from cabin to decknow
a word below and now a word with starbuck the chief mate

but at last he turned to his comrade with a final sort of look

chapter 23 the lee shore


some chapters back one bulkington was spoken of a tall newlanded
mariner encountered in new bedford at the inn

when on that shivering winters night the pequod thrust her vindictive
bows into the cold malicious waves who should i see standing at her
helm but bulkington i looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon
the man who in midwinter just landed from a four years dangerous
voyage could so unrestingly push off again for still another
tempestuous term the land seemed scorching to his feet wonderfullest
things are ever the unmentionable deep memories yield no epitaphs this
sixinch chapter is the stoneless grave of bulkington let me only say
that it fared with him as with the stormtossed ship that miserably
drives along the leeward land the port would fain give succor the port
is pitiful in the port is safety comfort hearthstone supper warm
blankets friends all thats kind to our mortalities but in that gale
the port the land is that ships direst jeopardy she must fly all
hospitality one touch of land though it but graze the keel would make
her shudder through and through with all her might she crowds all sail
off shore in so doing fights gainst the very winds that fain would
blow her homeward seeks all the lashed seas landlessness again
for refuges sake forlornly rushing into peril her only friend her
bitterest foe

know ye now bulkington glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid
effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea while
the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the
treacherous slavish shore

but as in landlessness alone resides highest truth shoreless
indefinite as godso better is it to perish in that howling infinite
than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee even if that were safety
for wormlike then oh who would craven crawl to land terrors of
the terrible is all this agony so vain take heart take heart
o bulkington bear thee grimly demigod up from the spray of thy
oceanperishingstraight up leaps thy apotheosis



chapter 24 the advocate


as queequeg and i are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling
and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among
landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit therefore i
am all anxiety to convince ye ye landsmen of the injustice hereby done
to us hunters of whales

in the first place it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish
the fact that among people at large the business of whaling is not
accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions if a
stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society
it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits were
he presented to the company as a harpooneer say and if in emulation
of the naval officers he should append the initials swf sperm
whale fishery to his visiting card such a procedure would be deemed
preeminently presuming and ridiculous

doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us
whalemen is this they think that at best our vocation amounts to a
butchering sort of business and that when actively engaged therein we
are surrounded by all manner of defilements butchers we are that is
true but butchers also and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been
all martial commanders whom the world invariably delights to honour and
as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business ye shall
soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown
and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the sperm whaleship
at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth but even
granting the charge in question to be true what disordered slippery
decks of a whaleship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those
battlefields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies
plaudits and if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit
of the soldiers profession let me assure ye that many a veteran
who has freely marched up to a battery would quickly recoil at the
apparition of the sperm whales vast tail fanning into eddies the air
over his head for what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared
with the interlinked terrors and wonders of god

but though the world scouts at us whale hunters yet does it
unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage yea an allabounding
adoration for almost all the tapers lamps and candles that burn round
the globe burn as before so many shrines to our glory

but look at this matter in other lights weigh it in all sorts of
scales see what we whalemen are and have been

why did the dutch in de witts time have admirals of their whaling
fleets why did louis xvi of france at his own personal expense fit
out whaling ships from dunkirk and politely invite to that town some
score or two of families from our own island of nantucket why did
britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties
upwards of l1000000 and lastly how comes it that we whalemen of
america now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world
sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels manned by eighteen
thousand men yearly consuming 4000000 of dollars the ships worth
at the time of sailing 20000000 and every year importing into our
harbors a well reaped harvest of 7000000 how comes all this if
there be not something puissant in whaling

but this is not the half look again

i freely assert that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot for his life
point out one single peaceful influence which within the last sixty
years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world taken in
one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling one way
and another it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves and so
continuously momentous in their sequential issues that whaling may
well be regarded as that egyptian mother who bore offspring themselves
pregnant from her womb it would be a hopeless endless task to
catalogue all these things let a handful suffice for many years past
the whaleship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and
least known parts of the earth she has explored seas and archipelagoes
which had no chart where no cook or vancouver had ever sailed if
american and european menofwar now peacefully ride in once savage
harbors let them fire salutes to the honour and glory of the
whaleship which originally showed them the way and first interpreted
between them and the savages they may celebrate as they will the heroes
of exploring expeditions your cooks your krusensterns but i say that
scores of anonymous captains have sailed out of nantucket that were
as great and greater than your cook and your krusenstern for in their
succourless emptyhandedness they in the heathenish sharked waters
and by the beaches of unrecorded javelin islands battled with virgin
wonders and terrors that cook with all his marines and muskets would
not willingly have dared all that is made such a flourish of in the old
south sea voyages those things were but the lifetime commonplaces of
our heroic nantucketers often adventures which vancouver dedicates
three chapters to these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the
ships common log ah the world oh the world

until the whale fishery rounded cape horn no commerce but colonial
scarcely any intercourse but colonial was carried on between europe and
the long line of the opulent spanish provinces on the pacific coast
it was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the
spanish crown touching those colonies and if space permitted it
might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the
liberation of peru chili and bolivia from the yoke of old spain and
the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts

that great america on the other side of the sphere australia was given
to the enlightened world by the whaleman after its first blunderborn
discovery by a dutchman all other ships long shunned those shores
as pestiferously barbarous but the whaleship touched there the
whaleship is the true mother of that now mighty colony moreover
in the infancy of the first australian settlement the emigrants were
several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the
whaleship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters the uncounted
isles of all polynesia confess the same truth and do commercial homage
to the whaleship that cleared the way for the missionary and the
merchant and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their
first destinations if that doublebolted land japan is ever to become
hospitable it is the whaleship alone to whom the credit will be due
for already she is on the threshold

but if in the face of all this you still declare that whaling has no
aesthetically noble associations connected with it then am i ready to
shiver fifty lances with you there and unhorse you with a split helmet
every time

the whale has no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler you
will say

the whale no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler who wrote
the first account of our leviathan who but mighty job and who composed
the first narrative of a whalingvoyage who but no less a prince than
alfred the great who with his own royal pen took down the words from
other the norwegian whalehunter of those times and who pronounced our
glowing eulogy in parliament who but edmund burke

true enough but then whalemen themselves are poor devils they have no
good blood in their veins

no good blood in their veins they have something better than royal
blood there the grandmother of benjamin franklin was mary morrel
afterwards by marriage mary folger one of the old settlers
of nantucket and the ancestress to a long line of folgers and
harpooneersall kith and kin to noble benjaminthis day darting the
barbed iron from one side of the world to the other

good again but then all confess that somehow whaling is not
respectable

whaling not respectable whaling is imperial by old english statutory
law the whale is declared a royal fish

oh thats only nominal the whale himself has never figured in any
grand imposing way

the whale never figured in any grand imposing way in one of the mighty
triumphs given to a roman general upon his entering the worlds capital
the bones of a whale brought all the way from the syrian coast were
the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession


see subsequent chapters for something more on this head


grant it since you cite it but say what you will there is no real
dignity in whaling

no dignity in whaling the dignity of our calling the very heavens
attest cetus is a constellation in the south no more drive down your
hat in presence of the czar and take it off to queequeg no more i
know a man that in his lifetime has taken three hundred and fifty
whales i account that man more honourable than that great captain of
antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns

and as for me if by any possibility there be any as yet undiscovered
prime thing in me if i shall ever deserve any real repute in that small
but high hushed world which i might not be unreasonably ambitious of if
hereafter i shall do anything that upon the whole a man might rather
have done than to have left undone if at my death my executors or
more properly my creditors find any precious mss in my desk then here
i prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling for a
whaleship was my yale college and my harvard



chapter 25 postscript


in behalf of the dignity of whaling i would fain advance naught but
substantiated facts but after embattling his facts an advocate who
should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise which might
tell eloquently upon his causesuch an advocate would he not be
blameworthy

it is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens even modern
ones a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is
gone through there is a saltcellar of state so called and there
may be a castor of state how they use the salt preciselywho knows
certain i am however that a kings head is solemnly oiled at his
coronation even as a head of salad can it be though that they
anoint it with a view of making its interior run well as they anoint
machinery much might be ruminated here concerning the essential
dignity of this regal process because in common life we esteem but
meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair and palpably
smells of that anointing in truth a mature man who uses hairoil
unless medicinally that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him
somewhere as a general rule he cant amount to much in his totality

but the only thing to be considered here is thiswhat kind of oil is
used at coronations certainly it cannot be olive oil nor macassar oil
nor castor oil nor bears oil nor train oil nor codliver oil what
then can it possibly be but sperm oil in its unmanufactured unpolluted
state the sweetest of all oils

think of that ye loyal britons we whalemen supply your kings and
queens with coronation stuff



chapter 26 knights and squires


the chief mate of the pequod was starbuck a native of nantucket and a
quaker by descent he was a long earnest man and though born on an icy
coast seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes his flesh being hard
as twicebaked biscuit transported to the indies his live blood would
not spoil like bottled ale he must have been born in some time of
general drought and famine or upon one of those fast days for which
his state is famous only some thirty arid summers had he seen those
summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness but this his
thinness so to speak seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and
cares than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight it was merely
the condensation of the man he was by no means illlooking quite the
contrary his pure tight skin was an excellent fit and closely wrapped
up in it and embalmed with inner health and strength like a revivified
egyptian this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come
and to endure always as now for be it polar snow or torrid sun like
a patent chronometer his interior vitality was warranted to do well
in all climates looking into his eyes you seemed to see there the yet
lingering images of those thousandfold perils he had calmly confronted
through life a staid steadfast man whose life for the most part was a
telling pantomime of action and not a tame chapter of sounds yet for
all his hardy sobriety and fortitude there were certain qualities
in him which at times affected and in some cases seemed well nigh to
overbalance all the rest uncommonly conscientious for a seaman and
endued with a deep natural reverence the wild watery loneliness of his
life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition but to that
sort of superstition which in some organizations seems rather to
spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance outward portents
and inward presentiments were his and if at times these things bent the
welded iron of his soul much more did his faraway domestic memories
of his young cape wife and child tend to bend him still more from the
original ruggedness of his nature and open him still further to those
latent influences which in some honesthearted men restrain the gush
of daredevil daring so often evinced by others in the more perilous
vicissitudes of the fishery i will have no man in my boat said
starbuck who is not afraid of a whale by this he seemed to mean
not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises
from the fair estimation of the encountered peril but that an utterly
fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward

aye aye said stubb the second mate starbuck there is as careful
a man as youll find anywhere in this fishery but we shall ere long
see what that word careful precisely means when used by a man like
stubb or almost any other whale hunter

starbuck was no crusader after perils in him courage was not a
sentiment but a thing simply useful to him and always at hand upon all
mortally practical occasions besides he thought perhaps that in this
business of whaling courage was one of the great staple outfits of
the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishly wasted
wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sundown nor
for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting
him for thought starbuck i am here in this critical ocean to kill
whales for my living and not to be killed by them for theirs and that
hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck well knew what doom was
his own fathers where in the bottomless deeps could he find the torn
limbs of his brother

with memories like these in him and moreover given to a certain
superstitiousness as has been said the courage of this starbuck which
could nevertheless still flourish must indeed have been extreme but
it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized and with such
terrible experiences and remembrances as he had it was not in nature
that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in
him which under suitable circumstances would break out from its
confinement and burn all his courage up and brave as he might be it
was that sort of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid men which
while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas or winds or
whales or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world yet
cannot withstand those more terrific because more spiritual terrors
which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and
mighty man

but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the complete
abasement of poor starbucks fortitude scarce might i have the heart to
write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking to expose
the fall of valour in the soul men may seem detestable as joint
stockcompanies and nations knaves fools and murderers there may be
men may have mean and meagre faces but man in the ideal is so noble
and so sparkling such a grand and glowing creature that over any
ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their
costliest robes that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves
so far within us that it remains intact though all the outer character
seem gone bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of
a valorruined man nor can piety itself at such a shameful sight
completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars but this
august dignity i treat of is not the dignity of kings and robes but
that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture thou shalt see it
shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike that democratic
dignity which on all hands radiates without end from god himself the
great god absolute the centre and circumference of all democracy his
omnipresence our divine equality

if then to meanest mariners and renegades and castaways i shall
hereafter ascribe high qualities though dark weave round them tragic
graces if even the most mournful perchance the most abased among them
all shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts if i shall touch
that workmans arm with some ethereal light if i shall spread a rainbow
over his disastrous set of sun then against all mortal critics bear
me out in it thou just spirit of equality which hast spread one royal
mantle of humanity over all my kind bear me out in it thou great
democratic god who didst not refuse to the swart convict bunyan the
pale poetic pearl thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves
of finest gold the stumped and paupered arm of old cervantes thou who
didst pick up andrew jackson from the pebbles who didst hurl him upon a
warhorse who didst thunder him higher than a throne thou who in all
thy mighty earthly marchings ever cullest thy selectest champions from
the kingly commons bear me out in it o god



chapter 27 knights and squires


stubb was the second mate he was a native of cape cod and hence
according to local usage was called a capecodman a happygolucky
neither craven nor valiant taking perils as they came with an
indifferent air and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the
chase toiling away calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged
for the year goodhumored easy and careless he presided over his
whaleboat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner and his
crew all invited guests he was as particular about the comfortable
arrangement of his part of the boat as an old stagedriver is about the
snugness of his box when close to the whale in the very deathlock of
the fight he handled his unpitying lance coolly and offhandedly as
a whistling tinker his hammer he would hum over his old rigadig tunes
while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster long usage had
for this stubb converted the jaws of death into an easy chair what he
thought of death itself there is no telling whether he ever thought of
it at all might be a question but if he ever did chance to cast his
mind that way after a comfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor
he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir
themselves there about something which he would find out when he obeyed
the order and not sooner

what perhaps with other things made stubb such an easygoing
unfearing man so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a
world full of grave pedlars all bowed to the ground with their packs
what helped to bring about that almost impious goodhumor of his that
thing must have been his pipe for like his nose his short black
little pipe was one of the regular features of his face you would
almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his
nose as without his pipe he kept a whole row of pipes there ready
loaded stuck in a rack within easy reach of his hand and whenever he
turned in he smoked them all out in succession lighting one from
the other to the end of the chapter then loading them again to be in
readiness anew for when stubb dressed instead of first putting his
legs into his trowsers he put his pipe into his mouth

i say this continual smoking must have been one cause at least of his
peculiar disposition for every one knows that this earthly air whether
ashore or afloat is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of
the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it and as in time of the
cholera some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their
mouths so likewise against all mortal tribulations stubbs tobacco
smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent

the third mate was flask a native of tisbury in marthas vineyard a
short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whales
who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally
and hereditarily affronted him and therefore it was a sort of point of
honour with him to destroy them whenever encountered so utterly lost
was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic
bulk and mystic ways and so dead to anything like an apprehension of
any possible danger from encountering them that in his poor opinion
the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse or at least
waterrat requiring only a little circumvention and some small
application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil this
ignorant unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in
the matter of whales he followed these fish for the fun of it and a
three years voyage round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lasted
that length of time as a carpenters nails are divided into wrought
nails and cut nails so mankind may be similarly divided little flask
was one of the wrought ones made to clinch tight and last long they
called him kingpost on board of the pequod because in form he could
be well likened to the short square timber known by that name in arctic
whalers and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted
into it serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those
battering seas

now these three matesstarbuck stubb and flask were momentous
men they it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the
pequods boats as headsmen in that grand order of battle in which
captain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales
these three headsmen were as captains of companies or being armed with
their long keen whaling spears they were as a picked trio of lancers
even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins

and since in this famous fishery each mate or headsman like a gothic
knight of old is always accompanied by his boatsteerer or harpooneer
who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance when
the former one has been badly twisted or elbowed in the assault and
moreover as there generally subsists between the two a close intimacy
and friendliness it is therefore but meet that in this place we set
down who the pequods harpooneers were and to what headsman each of
them belonged

first of all was queequeg whom starbuck the chief mate had selected
for his squire but queequeg is already known

next was tashtego an unmixed indian from gay head the most westerly
promontory of marthas vineyard where there still exists the last
remnant of a village of red men which has long supplied the neighboring
island of nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers in the
fishery they usually go by the generic name of gayheaders tashtegos
long lean sable hair his high cheek bones and black rounding
eyesfor an indian oriental in their largeness but antarctic in their
glittering expressionall this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor
of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters who in quest
of the great new england moose had scoured bow in hand the aboriginal
forests of the main but no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild
beasts of the woodland tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great
whales of the sea the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the
infallible arrow of the sires to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe
snaky limbs you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of
the earlier puritans and halfbelieved this wild indian to be a son
of the prince of the powers of the air tashtego was stubb the second
mates squire

third among the harpooneers was daggoo a gigantic coalblack
negrosavage with a lionlike treadan ahasuerus to behold suspended
from his ears were two golden hoops so large that the sailors called
them ringbolts and would talk of securing the topsail halyards to
them in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler
lying in a lonely bay on his native coast and never having been
anywhere in the world but in africa nantucket and the pagan harbors
most frequented by whalemen and having now led for many years the bold
life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what
manner of men they shipped daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues
and erect as a giraffe moved about the decks in all the pomp of six
feet five in his socks there was a corporeal humility in looking up at
him and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to
beg truce of a fortress curious to tell this imperial negro ahasuerus
daggoo was the squire of little flask who looked like a chessman
beside him as for the residue of the pequods company be it said that
at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the
mast employed in the american whale fishery are americans born though
pretty nearly all the officers are herein it is the same with the
american whale fishery as with the american army and military and
merchant navies and the engineering forces employed in the construction
of the american canals and railroads the same i say because in all
these cases the native american liberally provides the brains the rest
of the world as generously supplying the muscles no small number of
these whaling seamen belong to the azores where the outward bound
nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy
peasants of those rocky shores in like manner the greenland whalers
sailing out of hull or london put in at the shetland islands to
receive the full complement of their crew upon the passage homewards
they drop them there again how it is there is no telling but
islanders seem to make the best whalemen they were nearly all islanders
in the pequod isolatoes too i call such not acknowledging the common
continent of men but each isolato living on a separate continent of his
own yet now federated along one keel what a set these isolatoes were
an anacharsis clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea and all
the ends of the earth accompanying old ahab in the pequod to lay the
worlds grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever
come back black little piphe never didoh no he went before poor
alabama boy on the grim pequods forecastle ye shall ere long see him
beating his tambourine prelusive of the eternal time when sent for
to the great quarterdeck on high he was bid strike in with angels and
beat his tambourine in glory called a coward here hailed a hero there



chapter 28 ahab


for several days after leaving nantucket nothing above hatches was seen
of captain ahab the mates regularly relieved each other at the watches
and for aught that could be seen to the contrary they seemed to be the
only commanders of the ship only they sometimes issued from the cabin
with orders so sudden and peremptory that after all it was plain they
but commanded vicariously yes their supreme lord and dictator was
there though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate
into the now sacred retreat of the cabin

every time i ascended to the deck from my watches below i instantly
gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible for my first vague
disquietude touching the unknown captain now in the seclusion of the
sea became almost a perturbation this was strangely heightened
at times by the ragged elijahs diabolical incoherences uninvitedly
recurring to me with a subtle energy i could not have before conceived
of but poorly could i withstand them much as in other moods i was
almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish
prophet of the wharves but whatever it was of apprehensiveness or
uneasinessto call it sowhich i felt yet whenever i came to look
about me in the ship it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such
emotions for though the harpooneers with the great body of the crew
were a far more barbaric heathenish and motley set than any of the
tame merchantship companies which my previous experiences had made me
acquainted with still i ascribed thisand rightly ascribed itto the
fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation
in which i had so abandonedly embarked but it was especially the aspect
of the three chief officers of the ship the mates which was most
forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings and induce
confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage three
better more likely seaofficers and men each in his own different way
could not readily be found and they were every one of them americans a
nantucketer a vineyarder a cape man now it being christmas when the
ship shot from out her harbor for a space we had biting polar weather
though all the time running away from it to the southward and by every
degree and minute of latitude which we sailed gradually leaving that
merciless winter and all its intolerable weather behind us it was one
of those less lowering but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the
transition when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water
with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity that as i
mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon as i
levelled my glance towards the taffrail foreboding shivers ran over me
reality outran apprehension captain ahab stood upon his quarterdeck

there seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him nor of the
recovery from any he looked like a man cut away from the stake when
the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them
or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness his
whole high broad form seemed made of solid bronze and shaped in an
unalterable mould like cellinis cast perseus threading its way out
from among his grey hairs and continuing right down one side of his
tawny scorched face and neck till it disappeared in his clothing
you saw a slender rodlike mark lividly whitish it resembled that
perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight lofty trunk of
a great tree when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it and
without wrenching a single twig peels and grooves out the bark from top
to bottom ere running off into the soil leaving the tree still greenly
alive but branded whether that mark was born with him or whether it
was the scar left by some desperate wound no one could certainly say
by some tacit consent throughout the voyage little or no allusion was
made to it especially by the mates but once tashtegos senior an old
gayhead indian among the crew superstitiously asserted that not till
he was full forty years old did ahab become that way branded and
then it came upon him not in the fury of any mortal fray but in
an elemental strife at sea yet this wild hint seemed inferentially
negatived by what a grey manxman insinuated an old sepulchral man
who having never before sailed out of nantucket had never ere this
laid eye upon wild ahab nevertheless the old seatraditions the
immemorial credulities popularly invested this old manxman with
preternatural powers of discernment so that no white sailor seriously
contradicted him when he said that if ever captain ahab should
be tranquilly laid outwhich might hardly come to pass so he
mutteredthen whoever should do that last office for the dead would
find a birthmark on him from crown to sole

so powerfully did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect me and the livid
brand which streaked it that for the first few moments i hardly noted
that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric
white leg upon which he partly stood it had previously come to me that
this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of
the sperm whales jaw aye he was dismasted off japan said the old
gayhead indian once but like his dismasted craft he shipped another
mast without coming home for it he has a quiver of em

i was struck with the singular posture he maintained upon each side of
the pequods quarter deck and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds there
was an auger hole bored about half an inch or so into the plank
his bone leg steadied in that hole one arm elevated and holding by a
shroud captain ahab stood erect looking straight out beyond the
ships everpitching prow there was an infinity of firmest fortitude
a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness in the fixed and fearless
forward dedication of that glance not a word he spoke nor did his
officers say aught to him though by all their minutest gestures
and expressions they plainly showed the uneasy if not painful
consciousness of being under a troubled mastereye and not only that
but moody stricken ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his
face in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe

ere long from his first visit in the air he withdrew into his cabin
but after that morning he was every day visible to the crew either
standing in his pivothole or seated upon an ivory stool he had or
heavily walking the deck as the sky grew less gloomy indeed began to
grow a little genial he became still less and less a recluse as
if when the ship had sailed from home nothing but the dead wintry
bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded and by and by it
came to pass that he was almost continually in the air but as yet
for all that he said or perceptibly did on the at last sunny deck
he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast but the pequod was
only making a passage now not regularly cruising nearly all whaling
preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to so
that there was little or nothing out of himself to employ or excite
ahab now and thus chase away for that one interval the clouds that
layer upon layer were piled upon his brow as ever all clouds choose the
loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon

nevertheless ere long the warm warbling persuasiveness of the
pleasant holiday weather we came to seemed gradually to charm him from
his mood for as when the redcheeked dancing girls april and may
trip home to the wintry misanthropic woods even the barest ruggedest
most thundercloven old oak will at least send forth some few green
sprouts to welcome such gladhearted visitants so ahab did in the
end a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air more
than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look which in any
other man would have soon flowered out in a smile



chapter 29 enter ahab to him stubb


some days elapsed and ice and icebergs all astern the pequod now
went rolling through the bright quito spring which at sea almost
perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal august of the tropic
the warmly cool clear ringing perfumed overflowing redundant days
were as crystal goblets of persian sherbet heaped upflaked up with
rosewater snow the starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in
jewelled velvets nursing at home in lonely pride the memory of their
absent conquering earls the golden helmeted suns for sleeping man
twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights
but all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new
spells and potencies to the outward world inward they turned upon the
soul especially when the still mild hours of eve came on then memory
shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights
and all these subtle agencies more and more they wrought on ahabs
texture

old age is always wakeful as if the longer linked with life the less
man has to do with aught that looks like death among seacommanders
the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the
nightcloaked deck it was so with ahab only that now of late he
seemed so much to live in the open air that truly speaking his visits
were more to the cabin than from the cabin to the planks it feels
like going down into ones tombhe would mutter to himselffor an
old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle to go to my
gravedug berth

so almost every twentyfour hours when the watches of the night were
set and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below
and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle the sailors
flung it not rudely down as by day but with some cautiousness dropt
it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates when
this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail habitually the
silent steersman would watch the cabinscuttle and ere long the old man
would emerge gripping at the iron banister to help his crippled way
some considering touch of humanity was in him for at times like these
he usually abstained from patrolling the quarterdeck because to his
wearied mates seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel such
would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step that
their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks but once
the mood was on him too deep for common regardings and as with heavy
lumberlike pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast
stubb the old second mate came up from below with a certain
unassured deprecating humorousness hinted that if captain ahab was
pleased to walk the planks then no one could say nay but there might
be some way of muffling the noise hinting something indistinctly and
hesitatingly about a globe of tow and the insertion into it of the
ivory heel ah stubb thou didst not know ahab then

am i a cannonball stubb said ahab that thou wouldst wad me that
fashion but go thy ways i had forgot below to thy nightly grave
where such as ye sleep between shrouds to use ye to the filling one at
lastdown dog and kennel

starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
scornful old man stubb was speechless a moment then said excitedly i
am not used to be spoken to that way sir i do but less than half like
it sir

avast gritted ahab between his set teeth and violently moving away
as if to avoid some passionate temptation

no sir not yet said stubb emboldened i will not tamely be called
a dog sir

then be called ten times a donkey and a mule and an ass and begone
or ill clear the world of thee

as he said this ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in
his aspect that stubb involuntarily retreated

i was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it
muttered stubb as he found himself descending the cabinscuttle its
very queer stop stubb somehow now i dont well know whether to go
back and strike him orwhats thatdown here on my knees and pray
for him yes that was the thought coming up in me but it would be the
first time i ever did pray its queer very queer and hes queer too
aye take him fore and aft hes about the queerest old man stubb ever
sailed with how he flashed at mehis eyes like powderpans is he
mad anyway theres something on his mind as sure as there must be
something on a deck when it cracks he aint in his bed now either more
than three hours out of the twentyfour and he dont sleep then didnt
that doughboy the steward tell me that of a morning he always finds
the old mans hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled and the sheets
down at the foot and the coverlid almost tied into knots and the
pillow a sort of frightful hot as though a baked brick had been on
it a hot old man i guess hes got what some folks ashore call
a conscience its a kind of ticdollyrow they sayworse nor a
toothache well well i dont know what it is but the lord keep me
from catching it hes full of riddles i wonder what he goes into the
after hold for every night as doughboy tells me he suspects whats
that for i should like to know whos made appointments with him in
the hold aint that queer now but theres no telling its the old
gamehere goes for a snooze damn me its worth a fellows while to be
born into the world if only to fall right asleep and now that i think
of it thats about the first thing babies do and thats a sort of
queer too damn me but all things are queer come to think of em but
thats against my principles think not is my eleventh commandment and
sleep when you can is my twelfthso here goes again but hows that
didnt he call me a dog blazes he called me ten times a donkey and
piled a lot of jackasses on top of that he might as well have kicked
me and done with it maybe he did kick me and i didnt observe it
i was so taken all aback with his brow somehow it flashed like a
bleached bone what the devils the matter with me i dont stand right
on my legs coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong
side out by the lord i must have been dreaming thoughhow how
howbut the only ways to stash it so here goes to hammock again
and in the morning ill see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by
daylight



chapter 30 the pipe


when stubb had departed ahab stood for a while leaning over the
bulwarks and then as had been usual with him of late calling a sailor
of the watch he sent him below for his ivory stool and also his pipe
lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the
weather side of the deck he sat and smoked

in old norse times the thrones of the sealoving danish kings were
fabricated saith tradition of the tusks of the narwhale how could one
look at ahab then seated on that tripod of bones without bethinking
him of the royalty it symbolized for a khan of the plank and a king of
the sea and a great lord of leviathans was ahab

some moments passed during which the thick vapour came from his mouth
in quick and constant puffs which blew back again into his face how
now he soliloquized at last withdrawing the tube this smoking no
longer soothes oh my pipe hard must it go with me if thy charm be
gone here have i been unconsciously toiling not pleasuringaye and
ignorantly smoking to windward all the while to windward and with
such nervous whiffs as if like the dying whale my final jets were the
strongest and fullest of trouble what business have i with this pipe
this thing that is meant for sereneness to send up mild white vapours
among mild white hairs not among torn irongrey locks like mine ill
smoke no more

he tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea the fire hissed in the
waves the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe
made with slouched hat ahab lurchingly paced the planks



chapter 31 queen mab


next morning stubb accosted flask

such a queer dream kingpost i never had you know the old mans
ivory leg well i dreamed he kicked me with it and when i tried to kick
back upon my soul my little man i kicked my leg right off and then
presto ahab seemed a pyramid and i like a blazing fool kept kicking
at it but what was still more curious flaskyou know how curious all
dreams arethrough all this rage that i was in i somehow seemed to be
thinking to myself that after all it was not much of an insult that
kick from ahab why thinks i whats the row its not a real leg
only a false leg and theres a mighty difference between a living
thump and a dead thump thats what makes a blow from the hand flask
fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane the living
memberthat makes the living insult my little man and thinks i to
myself all the while mind while i was stubbing my silly toes against
that cursed pyramidso confoundedly contradictory was it all all
the while i say i was thinking to myself whats his leg now but
a canea whalebone cane yes thinks i it was only a playful
cudgellingin fact only a whaleboning that he gave menot a base
kick besides thinks i look at it once why the end of itthe foot
partwhat a small sort of end it is whereas if a broad footed farmer
kicked me theres a devilish broad insult but this insult is whittled
down to a point only but now comes the greatest joke of the
dream flask while i was battering away at the pyramid a sort of
badgerhaired old merman with a hump on his back takes me by the
shoulders and slews me round what are you bout says he slid man
but i was frightened such a phiz but somehow next moment i was over
the fright what am i about says i at last and what business is
that of yours i should like to know mr humpback do you want a kick
by the lord flask i had no sooner said that than he turned round his
stern to me bent over and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a
cloutwhat do you think i sawwhy thunder alive man his stern
was stuck full of marlinspikes with the points out says i on second
thoughts i guess i wont kick you old fellow wise stubb said he
wise stubb and kept muttering it all the time a sort of eating of
his own gums like a chimney hag seeing he wasnt going to stop saying
over his wise stubb wise stubb i thought i might as well fall to
kicking the pyramid again but i had only just lifted my foot for it
when he roared out stop that kicking halloa says i whats
the matter now old fellow look ye here says he lets argue
the insult captain ahab kicked ye didnt he yes he did says
iright here it was very good says hehe used his ivory leg
didnt he yes he did says i well then says he wise stubb
what have you to complain of didnt he kick with right good will it
wasnt a common pitch pine leg he kicked with was it no you were
kicked by a great man and with a beautiful ivory leg stubb its an
honour i consider it an honour listen wise stubb in old england the
greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen and made
garterknights of but be your boast stubb that ye were kicked by
old ahab and made a wise man of remember what i say be kicked by him
account his kicks honours and on no account kick back for you cant
help yourself wise stubb dont you see that pyramid with that he
all of a sudden seemed somehow in some queer fashion to swim off into
the air i snored rolled over and there i was in my hammock now what
do you think of that dream flask

i dont know it seems a sort of foolish to me tho

may be may be but its made a wise man of me flask dye see ahab
standing there sideways looking over the stern well the best thing
you can do flask is to let the old man alone never speak to him
whatever he says halloa whats that he shouts hark

masthead there look sharp all of ye there are whales hereabouts

if ye see a white one split your lungs for him

what do you think of that now flask aint there a small drop of
something queer about that eh a white whaledid ye mark that man
look yetheres something special in the wind stand by for it flask
ahab has that thats bloody on his mind but mum he comes this way



chapter 32 cetology


already we are boldly launched upon the deep but soon we shall be lost
in its unshored harbourless immensities ere that come to pass ere the
pequods weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the
leviathan at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost
indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more
special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to
follow

it is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera
that i would now fain put before you yet is it no easy task the
classification of the constituents of a chaos nothing less is here
essayed listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down

no branch of zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled
cetology says captain scoresby ad 1820

it is not my intention were it in my power to enter into the
inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and
families utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal
sperm whale says surgeon beale ad 1839

unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters
impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea a field
strewn with thorns all these incomplete indications but serve to
torture us naturalists

thus speak of the whale the great cuvier and john hunter and lesson
those lights of zoology and anatomy nevertheless though of real
knowledge there be little yet of books there are a plenty and so in
some small degree with cetology or the science of whales many are
the men small and great old and new landsmen and seamen who have at
large or in little written of the whale run over a fewthe authors
of the bible aristotle pliny aldrovandi sir thomas browne gesner
ray linnaeus rondeletius willoughby green artedi sibbald brisson
marten lacepede bonneterre desmarest baron cuvier frederick cuvier
john hunter owen scoresby beale bennett j ross browne the
author of miriam coffin olmstead and the rev t cheever but to what
ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written the above cited
extracts will show

of the names in this list of whale authors only those following owen
ever saw living whales and but one of them was a real professional
harpooneer and whaleman i mean captain scoresby on the separate
subject of the greenland or rightwhale he is the best existing
authority but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great
sperm whale compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthy
mentioning and here be it said that the greenland whale is an usurper
upon the throne of the seas he is not even by any means the largest
of the whales yet owing to the long priority of his claims and the
profound ignorance which till some seventy years back invested the
then fabulous or utterly unknown spermwhale and which ignorance to
this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats
and whaleports this usurpation has been every way complete reference
to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days
will satisfy you that the greenland whale without one rival was to
them the monarch of the seas but the time has at last come for a new
proclamation this is charing cross hear ye good people allthe
greenland whale is deposedthe great sperm whale now reigneth

there are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living
sperm whale before you and at the same time in the remotest degree
succeed in the attempt those books are beales and bennetts both in
their time surgeons to english southsea whaleships and both exact and
reliable men the original matter touching the sperm whale to be found
in their volumes is necessarily small but so far as it goes it is of
excellent quality though mostly confined to scientific description as
yet however the sperm whale scientific or poetic lives not complete
in any literature far above all other hunted whales his is an
unwritten life

now the various species of whales need some sort of popular
comprehensive classification if only an easy outline one for the
present hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent
laborers as no better man advances to take this matter in hand i
hereupon offer my own poor endeavors i promise nothing complete
because any human thing supposed to be complete must for that very
reason infallibly be faulty i shall not pretend to a minute anatomical
description of the various species orin this place at leastto much
of any description my object here is simply to project the draught of a
systematization of cetology i am the architect not the builder

but it is a ponderous task no ordinary lettersorter in the postoffice
is equal to it to grope down into the bottom of the sea after them
to have ones hands among the unspeakable foundations ribs and very
pelvis of the world this is a fearful thing what am i that i should
essay to hook the nose of this leviathan the awful tauntings in job
might well appal me will he the leviathan make a covenant with thee
behold the hope of him is vain but i have swam through libraries and
sailed through oceans i have had to do with whales with these visible
hands i am in earnest and i will try there are some preliminaries to
settle

first the uncertain unsettled condition of this science of cetology
is in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in some quarters it
still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish in his system of
nature ad 1776 linnaeus declares i hereby separate the whales from
the fish but of my own knowledge i know that down to the year 1850
sharks and shad alewives and herring against linnaeuss express edict
were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the
leviathan

the grounds upon which linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from
the waters he states as follows on account of their warm bilocular
heart their lungs their movable eyelids their hollow ears penem
intrantem feminam mammis lactantem and finally ex lege naturae jure
meritoque i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charley
coffin of nantucket both messmates of mine in a certain voyage and
they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether
insufficient charley profanely hinted they were humbug

be it known that waiving all argument i take the good old fashioned
ground that the whale is a fish and call upon holy jonah to back me
this fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internal
respect does the whale differ from other fish above linnaeus has given
you those items but in brief they are these lungs and warm blood
whereas all other fish are lungless and cold blooded

next how shall we define the whale by his obvious externals so as
conspicuously to label him for all time to come to be short then a
whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail there you have
him however contracted that definition is the result of expanded
meditation a walrus spouts much like a whale but the walrus is not a
fish because he is amphibious but the last term of the definition is
still more cogent as coupled with the first almost any one must have
noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat but a
vertical or upanddown tail whereas among spouting fish the tail
though it may be similarly shaped invariably assumes a horizontal
position

by the above definition of what a whale is i do by no means exclude
from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified
with the whale by the best informed nantucketers nor on the other
hand link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien
hence all the smaller spouting and horizontal tailed fish must be
included in this groundplan of cetology now then come the grand
divisions of the entire whale host


i am aware that down to the present time the fish styled lamatins and
dugongs pigfish and sowfish of the coffins of nantucket are included
by many naturalists among the whales but as these pigfish are a noisy
contemptible set mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers and feeding on
wet hay and especially as they do not spout i deny their credentials
as whales and have presented them with their passports to quit the
kingdom of cetology


first according to magnitude i divide the whales into three primary
books subdivisible into chapters and these shall comprehend them all
both small and large

i the folio whale ii the octavo whale iii the duodecimo whale

as the type of the folio i present the sperm whale of the octavo the
grampus of the duodecimo the porpoise

folios among these i here include the following chaptersi the sperm
whale ii the right whale iii the finback whale iv the humpbacked
whale v the razorback whale vi the sulphurbottom whale

book i folio chapter i sperm whalethis whale among the
english of old vaguely known as the trumpa whale and the physeter
whale and the anvil headed whale is the present cachalot of the
french and the pottsfich of the germans and the macrocephalus of the
long words he is without doubt the largest inhabitant of the globe
the most formidable of all whales to encounter the most majestic in
aspect and lastly by far the most valuable in commerce he being
the only creature from which that valuable substance spermaceti is
obtained all his peculiarities will in many other places be enlarged
upon it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do philologically
considered it is absurd some centuries ago when the sperm whale was
almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality and when his oil
was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish in those days
spermaceti it would seem was popularly supposed to be derived from a
creature identical with the one then known in england as the greenland
or right whale it was the idea also that this same spermaceti was that
quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllable of
the word literally expresses in those times also spermaceti was
exceedingly scarce not being used for light but only as an ointment
and medicament it was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays
buy an ounce of rhubarb when as i opine in the course of time the
true nature of spermaceti became known its original name was still
retained by the dealers no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so
strangely significant of its scarcity and so the appellation must at
last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti
was really derived

book i folio chapter ii right whalein one respect this is the
most venerable of the leviathans being the one first regularly hunted
by man it yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen and
the oil specially known as whale oil an inferior article in commerce
among the fishermen he is indiscriminately designated by all the
following titles the whale the greenland whale the black whale
the great whale the true whale the right whale there is a deal of
obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously
baptised what then is the whale which i include in the second species
of my folios it is the great mysticetus of the english naturalists the
greenland whale of the english whalemen the baliene ordinaire of the
french whalemen the growlands walfish of the swedes it is the whale
which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the dutch and
english in the arctic seas it is the whale which the american fishermen
have long pursued in the indian ocean on the brazil banks on the nor
west coast and various other parts of the world designated by them
right whale cruising grounds

some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of the
english and the right whale of the americans but they precisely agree
in all their grand features nor has there yet been presented a single
determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction it is by
endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences that
some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate the
right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length with reference
to elucidating the sperm whale

book i folio chapter iii finbackunder this head i reckon
a monster which by the various names of finback tallspout and
longjohn has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale
whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the
atlantic in the new york packettracks in the length he attains and
in his baleen the finback resembles the right whale but is of a less
portly girth and a lighter colour approaching to olive his great lips
present a cablelike aspect formed by the intertwisting slanting folds
of large wrinkles his grand distinguishing feature the fin from which
he derives his name is often a conspicuous object this fin is some
three or four feet long growing vertically from the hinder part of the
back of an angular shape and with a very sharp pointed end even if
not the slightest other part of the creature be visible this isolated
fin will at times be seen plainly projecting from the surface when
the sea is moderately calm and slightly marked with spherical ripples
and this gnomonlike fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled
surface it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it
somewhat resembles a dial with its style and wavy hourlines graved on
it on that ahazdial the shadow often goes back the finback is not
gregarious he seems a whalehater as some men are manhaters very
shy always going solitary unexpectedly rising to the surface in the
remotest and most sullen waters his straight and single lofty jet
rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain gifted with
such wondrous power and velocity in swimming as to defy all present
pursuit from man this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable
cain of his race bearing for his mark that style upon his back from
having the baleen in his mouth the finback is sometimes included with
the right whale among a theoretic species denominated whalebone whales
that is whales with baleen of these so called whalebone whales there
would seem to be several varieties most of which however are little
known broadnosed whales and beaked whales pikeheaded whales bunched
whales underjawed whales and rostrated whales are the fishermens
names for a few sorts

in connection with this appellative of whalebone whales it is of
great importance to mention that however such a nomenclature may be
convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales yet it is
in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan founded upon
either his baleen or hump or fin or teeth notwithstanding that those
marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford
the basis for a regular system of cetology than any other detached
bodily distinctions which the whale in his kinds presents how
then the baleen hump backfin and teeth these are things whose
peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales
without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other
and more essential particulars thus the sperm whale and the humpbacked
whale each has a hump but there the similitude ceases then this same
humpbacked whale and the greenland whale each of these has baleen
but there again the similitude ceases and it is just the same with the
other parts above mentioned in various sorts of whales they form such
irregular combinations or in the case of any one of them detached
such an irregular isolation as utterly to defy all general
methodization formed upon such a basis on this rock every one of the
whalenaturalists has split

but it may possibly be conceived that in the internal parts of the
whale in his anatomythere at least we shall be able to hit the
right classification nay what thing for example is there in the
greenland whales anatomy more striking than his baleen yet we have
seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the
greenland whale and if you descend into the bowels of the various
leviathans why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as
available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated
what then remains nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily in
their entire liberal volume and boldly sort them that way and this is
the bibliographical system here adopted and it is the only one that can
possibly succeed for it alone is practicable to proceed

book i folio chapter iv humpbackthis whale is often seen on
the northern american coast he has been frequently captured there and
towed into harbor he has a great pack on him like a peddler or you
might call him the elephant and castle whale at any rate the popular
name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him since the sperm
whale also has a hump though a smaller one his oil is not very
valuable he has baleen he is the most gamesome and lighthearted of
all the whales making more gay foam and white water generally than any
other of them

book i folio chapter v razorbackof this whale little is known
but his name i have seen him at a distance off cape horn of a retiring
nature he eludes both hunters and philosophers though no coward he
has never yet shown any part of him but his back which rises in a long
sharp ridge let him go i know little more of him nor does anybody
else

book i folio chapter vi sulphurbottomanother retiring
gentleman with a brimstone belly doubtless got by scraping along the
tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings he is seldom seen
at least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas
and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance he is
never chased he would run away with ropewalks of line prodigies are
told of him adieu sulphur bottom i can say nothing more that is true
of ye nor can the oldest nantucketer

thus ends book i folio and now begins book ii octavo

octavoesthese embrace the whales of middling magnitude among which
present may be numberedi the grampus ii the black fish iii
the narwhale iv the thrasher v the killer


why this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plain
because while the whales of this order though smaller than those of
the former order nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them
in figure yet the bookbinders quarto volume in its dimensioned form
does not preserve the shape of the folio volume but the octavo volume
does


book ii octavo chapter i grampusthough this fish whose
loud sonorous breathing or rather blowing has furnished a proverb
to landsmen is so well known a denizen of the deep yet is he not
popularly classed among whales but possessing all the grand distinctive
features of the leviathan most naturalists have recognised him for one
he is of moderate octavo size varying from fifteen to twentyfive feet
in length and of corresponding dimensions round the waist he swims in
herds he is never regularly hunted though his oil is considerable in
quantity and pretty good for light by some fishermen his approach is
regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale

book ii octavo chapter ii black fishi give the popular
fishermens names for all these fish for generally they are the best
where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive i shall say so
and suggest another i do so now touching the black fish socalled
because blackness is the rule among almost all whales so call him the
hyena whale if you please his voracity is well known and from the
circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards he
carries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face this whale
averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length he is found in almost
all latitudes he has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin
in swimming which looks something like a roman nose when not more
profitably employed the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the hyena
whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employmentas
some frugal housekeepers in the absence of company and quite alone by
themselves burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax though their
blubber is very thin some of these whales will yield you upwards of
thirty gallons of oil

book ii octavo chapter iii narwhale that is nostril
whaleanother instance of a curiously named whale so named i suppose
from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose the
creature is some sixteen feet in length while its horn averages five
feet though some exceed ten and even attain to fifteen feet strictly
speaking this horn is but a lengthened tusk growing out from the jaw
in a line a little depressed from the horizontal but it is only
found on the sinister side which has an ill effect giving its owner
something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy lefthanded man what
precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers it would be hard to
say it does not seem to be used like the blade of the swordfish and
billfish though some sailors tell me that the narwhale employs it for
a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food charley coffin
said it was used for an icepiercer for the narwhale rising to the
surface of the polar sea and finding it sheeted with ice thrusts his
horn up and so breaks through but you cannot prove either of these
surmises to be correct my own opinion is that however this onesided
horn may really be used by the narwhalehowever that may beit would
certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets
the narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale the horned whale and
the unicorn whale he is certainly a curious example of the unicornism
to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature from certain
cloistered old authors i have gathered that this same seaunicorns horn
was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison
and as such preparations of it brought immense prices it was also
distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies the same way that the
horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn originally it
was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity black letter tells
me that sir martin frobisher on his return from that voyage when
queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window
of greenwich palace as his bold ship sailed down the thames when sir
martin returned from that voyage saith black letter on bended knees
he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the narwhale
which for a long period after hung in the castle at windsor an irish
author avers that the earl of leicester on bended knees did likewise
present to her highness another horn pertaining to a land beast of the
unicorn nature

the narwhale has a very picturesque leopardlike look being of a
milkwhite ground colour dotted with round and oblong spots of black
his oil is very superior clear and fine but there is little of it and
he is seldom hunted he is mostly found in the circumpolar seas

book ii octavo chapter iv killerof this whale little is
precisely known to the nantucketer and nothing at all to the professed
naturalist from what i have seen of him at a distance i should say
that he was about the bigness of a grampus he is very savagea sort of
feegee fish he sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip and
hangs there like a leech till the mighty brute is worried to death the
killer is never hunted i never heard what sort of oil he has exception
might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale on the ground
of its indistinctness for we are all killers on land and on sea
bonapartes and sharks included

book ii octavo chapter v thrasherthis gentleman is famous for
his tail which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes he mounts
the folio whales back and as he swims he works his passage by
flogging him as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar
process still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer both
are outlaws even in the lawless seas

thus ends book ii octavo and begins book iii duodecimo

duodecimoesthese include the smaller whales i the huzza porpoise
ii the algerine porpoise iii the mealymouthed porpoise

to those who have not chanced specially to study the subject it may
possibly seem strange that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five
feet should be marshalled among whalesa word which in the popular
sense always conveys an idea of hugeness but the creatures set
down above as duodecimoes are infallibly whales by the terms of my
definition of what a whale isie a spouting fish with a horizontal
tail

book iii duodecimo chapter 1 huzza porpoisethis is the
common porpoise found almost all over the globe the name is of my own
bestowal for there are more than one sort of porpoises and something
must be done to distinguish them i call him thus because he always
swims in hilarious shoals which upon the broad sea keep tossing
themselves to heaven like caps in a fourthofjuly crowd their
appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner full of fine
spirits they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward they
are the lads that always live before the wind they are accounted a
lucky omen if you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding
these vivacious fish then heaven help ye the spirit of godly
gamesomeness is not in ye a wellfed plump huzza porpoise will
yield you one good gallon of good oil but the fine and delicate fluid
extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable it is in request among
jewellers and watchmakers sailors put it on their hones porpoise
meat is good eating you know it may never have occurred to you that
a porpoise spouts indeed his spout is so small that it is not very
readily discernible but the next time you have a chance watch him and
you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniature

book iii duodecimo chapter ii algerine porpoisea pirate very
savage he is only found i think in the pacific he is somewhat larger
than the huzza porpoise but much of the same general make provoke him
and he will buckle to a shark i have lowered for him many times but
never yet saw him captured

book iii duodecimo chapter iii mealymouthed porpoisethe
largest kind of porpoise and only found in the pacific so far as it is
known the only english name by which he has hitherto been designated
is that of the fishersrightwhale porpoise from the circumstance that
he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio in shape he differs
in some degree from the huzza porpoise being of a less rotund and jolly
girth indeed he is of quite a neat and gentlemanlike figure he has
no fins on his back most other porpoises have he has a lovely tail
and sentimental indian eyes of a hazel hue but his mealymouth spoils
all though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable
yet a boundary line distinct as the mark in a ships hull called
the bright waist that line streaks him from stem to stern with two
separate colours black above and white below the white comprises part
of his head and the whole of his mouth which makes him look as if he
had just escaped from a felonious visit to a mealbag a most mean and
mealy aspect his oil is much like that of the common porpoise


beyond the duodecimo this system does not proceed inasmuch as
the porpoise is the smallest of the whales above you have all the
leviathans of note but there are a rabble of uncertain fugitive
halffabulous whales which as an american whaleman i know by
reputation but not personally i shall enumerate them by their
forecastle appellations for possibly such a list may be valuable to
future investigators who may complete what i have here but begun if
any of the following whales shall hereafter be caught and marked then
he can readily be incorporated into this system according to his folio
octavo or duodecimo magnitudethe bottlenose whale the junk whale
the puddingheaded whale the cape whale the leading whale the cannon
whale the scragg whale the coppered whale the elephant whale the
iceberg whale the quog whale the blue whale etc from icelandic
dutch and old english authorities there might be quoted other lists of
uncertain whales blessed with all manner of uncouth names but i omit
them as altogether obsolete and can hardly help suspecting them for
mere sounds full of leviathanism but signifying nothing

finally it was stated at the outset that this system would not be
here and at once perfected you cannot but plainly see that i have
kept my word but i now leave my cetological system standing thus
unfinished even as the great cathedral of cologne was left with the
crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower for small
erections may be finished by their first architects grand ones true
ones ever leave the copestone to posterity god keep me from ever
completing anything this whole book is but a draughtnay but the
draught of a draught oh time strength cash and patience



chapter 33 the specksnyder


concerning the officers of the whalecraft this seems as good a place
as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on shipboard arising
from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers a class unknown
of course in any other marine than the whalefleet

the large importance attached to the harpooneers vocation is evinced
by the fact that originally in the old dutch fishery two centuries
and more ago the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in
the person now called the captain but was divided between him and an
officer called the specksnyder literally this word means fatcutter
usage however in time made it equivalent to chief harpooneer in
those days the captains authority was restricted to the navigation
and general management of the vessel while over the whalehunting
department and all its concerns the specksnyder or chief harpooneer
reigned supreme in the british greenland fishery under the corrupted
title of specksioneer this old dutch official is still retained but
his former dignity is sadly abridged at present he ranks simply
as senior harpooneer and as such is but one of the captains more
inferior subalterns nevertheless as upon the good conduct of the
harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends and since
in the american fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat
but under certain circumstances night watches on a whaling ground the
command of the ships deck is also his therefore the grand political
maxim of the sea demands that he should nominally live apart from
the men before the mast and be in some way distinguished as their
professional superior though always by them familiarly regarded as
their social equal

now the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea is
thisthe first lives aft the last forward hence in whaleships and
merchantmen alike the mates have their quarters with the captain and
so too in most of the american whalers the harpooneers are lodged in
the after part of the ship that is to say they take their meals in the
captains cabin and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it

though the long period of a southern whaling voyage by far the longest
of all voyages now or ever made by man the peculiar perils of it and
the community of interest prevailing among a company all of whom high
or low depend for their profits not upon fixed wages but upon their
common luck together with their common vigilance intrepidity and
hard work though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less
rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally yet never mind
how much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may in some
primitive instances live together for all that the punctilious
externals at least of the quarterdeck are seldom materially relaxed
and in no instance done away indeed many are the nantucket ships in
which you will see the skipper parading his quarterdeck with an elated
grandeur not surpassed in any military navy nay extorting almost
as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple and not the
shabbiest of pilotcloth

and though of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the least
given to that sort of shallowest assumption and though the only homage
he ever exacted was implicit instantaneous obedience though he
required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon
the quarterdeck and though there were times when owing to peculiar
circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed he
addressed them in unusual terms whether of condescension or in
terrorem or otherwise yet even captain ahab was by no means
unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea

nor perhaps will it fail to be eventually perceived that behind those
forms and usages as it were he sometimes masked himself incidentally
making use of them for other and more private ends than they were
legitimately intended to subserve that certain sultanism of his brain
which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested through
those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible
dictatorship for be a mans intellectual superiority what it will
it can never assume the practical available supremacy over other men
without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments always
in themselves more or less paltry and base this it is that for ever
keeps gods true princes of the empire from the worlds hustings and
leaves the highest honours that this air can give to those men who
become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice
hidden handful of the divine inert than through their undoubted
superiority over the dead level of the mass such large virtue lurks
in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them
that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted
potency but when as in the case of nicholas the czar the ringed crown
of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain then the plebeian
herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization nor will the
tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest
sweep and direct swing ever forget a hint incidentally so important in
his art as the one now alluded to

but ahab my captain still moves before me in all his nantucket
grimness and shagginess and in this episode touching emperors and
kings i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old
whalehunter like him and therefore all outward majestical trappings
and housings are denied me oh ahab what shall be grand in thee it
must needs be plucked at from the skies and dived for in the deep and
featured in the unbodied air



chapter 34 the cabintable


it is noon and doughboy the steward thrusting his pale loafofbread
face from the cabinscuttle announces dinner to his lord and
master who sitting in the lee quarterboat has just been taking an
observation of the sun and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the
smooth medallionshaped tablet reserved for that daily purpose on
the upper part of his ivory leg from his complete inattention to the
tidings you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial but
presently catching hold of the mizen shrouds he swings himself to
the deck and in an even unexhilarated voice saying dinner mr
starbuck disappears into the cabin

when the last echo of his sultans step has died away and starbuck the
first emir has every reason to suppose that he is seated then starbuck
rouses from his quietude takes a few turns along the planks and after
a grave peep into the binnacle says with some touch of pleasantness
dinner mr stubb and descends the scuttle the second emir lounges
about the rigging awhile and then slightly shaking the main brace to
see whether it will be all right with that important rope he likewise
takes up the old burden and with a rapid dinner mr flask follows
after his predecessors

but the third emir now seeing himself all alone on the quarterdeck
seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping all
sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions and kicking off his
shoes he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right
over the grand turks head and then by a dexterous sleight pitching
his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf he goes down rollicking so
far at least as he remains visible from the deck reversing all other
processions by bringing up the rear with music but ere stepping into
the cabin doorway below he pauses ships a new face altogether and
then independent hilarious little flask enters king ahabs presence
in the character of abjectus or the slave

it is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
artificialness of seausages that while in the open air of the deck
some officers will upon provocation bear themselves boldly and
defyingly enough towards their commander yet ten to one let those
very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that
same commanders cabin and straightway their inoffensive not to say
deprecatory and humble air towards him as he sits at the head of
the table this is marvellous sometimes most comical wherefore this
difference a problem perhaps not to have been belshazzar king of
babylon and to have been belshazzar not haughtily but courteously
therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur but he
who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own
private dinnertable of invited guests that mans unchallenged power
and dominion of individual influence for the time that mans royalty of
state transcends belshazzars for belshazzar was not the greatest who
has but once dined his friends has tasted what it is to be caesar it
is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding now
if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a
shipmaster then by inference you will derive the cause of that
peculiarity of sealife just mentioned

over his ivoryinlaid table ahab presided like a mute maned
sealion on the white coral beach surrounded by his warlike but still
deferential cubs in his own proper turn each officer waited to be
served they were as little children before ahab and yet in ahab
there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance with one mind
their intent eyes all fastened upon the old mans knife as he carved
the chief dish before him i do not suppose that for the world they
would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation even
upon so neutral a topic as the weather no and when reaching out his
knife and fork between which the slice of beef was locked ahab thereby
motioned starbucks plate towards him the mate received his meat as
though receiving alms and cut it tenderly and a little started
if perchance the knife grazed against the plate and chewed it
noiselessly and swallowed it not without circumspection for like
the coronation banquet at frankfort where the german emperor profoundly
dines with the seven imperial electors so these cabin meals were
somehow solemn meals eaten in awful silence and yet at table old ahab
forbade not conversation only he himself was dumb what a relief it was
to choking stubb when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below and
poor little flask he was the youngest son and little boy of this weary
family party his were the shinbones of the saline beef his would have
been the drumsticks for flask to have presumed to help himself this
must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree had
he helped himself at that table doubtless never more would he have
been able to hold his head up in this honest world nevertheless
strange to say ahab never forbade him and had flask helped himself
the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it least of all did
flask presume to help himself to butter whether he thought the owners
of the ship denied it to him on account of its clotting his clear
sunny complexion or whether he deemed that on so long a voyage in such
marketless waters butter was at a premium and therefore was not for
him a subaltern however it was flask alas was a butterless man

another thing flask was the last person down at the dinner and flask
is the first man up consider for hereby flasks dinner was badly
jammed in point of time starbuck and stubb both had the start of him
and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear if stubb
even who is but a peg higher than flask happens to have but a small
appetite and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast then flask
must bestir himself he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day
for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck
therefore it was that flask once admitted in private that ever since he
had arisen to the dignity of an officer from that moment he had never
known what it was to be otherwise than hungry more or less for what
he ate did not so much relieve his hunger as keep it immortal in him
peace and satisfaction thought flask have for ever departed from
my stomach i am an officer but how i wish i could fish a bit of
oldfashioned beef in the forecastle as i used to when i was before the
mast theres the fruits of promotion now theres the vanity of glory
theres the insanity of life besides if it were so that any mere
sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flasks official
capacity all that sailor had to do in order to obtain ample vengeance
was to go aft at dinnertime and get a peep at flask through the cabin
skylight sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful ahab

now ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table
in the pequods cabin after their departure taking place in inverted
order to their arrival the canvas cloth was cleared or rather was
restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward and then the three
harpooneers were bidden to the feast they being its residuary legatees
they made a sort of temporary servants hall of the high and mighty
cabin

in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
invisible domineerings of the captains table was the entire carefree
license and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows
the harpooneers while their masters the mates seemed afraid of the
sound of the hinges of their own jaws the harpooneers chewed their food
with such a relish that there was a report to it they dined like lords
they filled their bellies like indian ships all day loading with spices
such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego that to fill out
the vacancies made by the previous repast often the pale doughboy was
fain to bring on a great baron of saltjunk seemingly quarried out of
the solid ox and if he were not lively about it if he did not go with
a nimble hopskipandjump then tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of
accelerating him by darting a fork at his back harpoonwise and once
daggoo seized with a sudden humor assisted doughboys memory by
snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head into a great empty
wooden trencher while tashtego knife in hand began laying out the
circle preliminary to scalping him he was naturally a very nervous
shuddering sort of little fellow this breadfaced steward the progeny
of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse and what with the standing
spectacle of the black terrific ahab and the periodical tumultuous
visitations of these three savages doughboys whole life was one
continual lipquiver commonly after seeing the harpooneers furnished
with all things they demanded he would escape from their clutches into
his little pantry adjoining and fearfully peep out at them through the
blinds of its door till all was over

it was a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego opposing
his filed teeth to the indians crosswise to them daggoo seated on the
floor for a bench would have brought his hearseplumed head to the low
carlines at every motion of his colossal limbs making the low cabin
framework to shake as when an african elephant goes passenger in a
ship but for all this the great negro was wonderfully abstemious
not to say dainty it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively
small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad
baronial and superb a person but doubtless this noble savage fed
strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air and through his
dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds not by
beef or by bread are giants made or nourished but queequeg he had a
mortal barbaric smack of the lip in eatingan ugly sound enoughso
much so that the trembling doughboy almost looked to see whether
any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms and when he would hear
tashtego singing out for him to produce himself that his bones might be
picked the simplewitted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging
round him in the pantry by his sudden fits of the palsy nor did the
whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets for their
lances and other weapons and with which whetstones at dinner they
would ostentatiously sharpen their knives that grating sound did not at
all tend to tranquillize poor doughboy how could he forget that in his
island days queequeg for one must certainly have been guilty of some
murderous convivial indiscretions alas doughboy hard fares the
white waiter who waits upon cannibals not a napkin should he carry on
his arm but a buckler in good time though to his great delight
the three saltsea warriors would rise and depart to his credulous
fablemongering ears all their martial bones jingling in them at every
step like moorish scimetars in scabbards

but though these barbarians dined in the cabin and nominally lived
there still being anything but sedentary in their habits they were
scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes and just before sleepingtime
when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters

in this one matter ahab seemed no exception to most american whale
captains who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by rights
the ships cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alone that
anybody else is at any time permitted there so that in real truth
the mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said to
have lived out of the cabin than in it for when they did enter it it
was something as a streetdoor enters a house turning inwards for
a moment only to be turned out the next and as a permanent thing
residing in the open air nor did they lose much hereby in the cabin
was no companionship socially ahab was inaccessible though nominally
included in the census of christendom he was still an alien to it he
lived in the world as the last of the grisly bears lived in settled
missouri and as when spring and summer had departed that wild logan of
the woods burying himself in the hollow of a tree lived out the winter
there sucking his own paws so in his inclement howling old age
ahabs soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed upon the
sullen paws of its gloom



chapter 35 the masthead


it was during the more pleasant weather that in due rotation with the
other seamen my first masthead came round

in most american whalemen the mastheads are manned almost
simultaneously with the vessels leaving her port even though she may
have fifteen thousand miles and more to sail ere reaching her proper
cruising ground and if after a three four or five years voyage
she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in hersay an empty vial
eventhen her mastheads are kept manned to the last and not till her
skysailpoles sail in among the spires of the port does she altogether
relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more

now as the business of standing mastheads ashore or afloat is a very
ancient and interesting one let us in some measure expatiate here
i take it that the earliest standers of mastheads were the old
egyptians because in all my researches i find none prior to them
for though their progenitors the builders of babel must doubtless by
their tower have intended to rear the loftiest masthead in all asia
or africa either yet ere the final truck was put to it as that great
stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board in the dread
gale of gods wrath therefore we cannot give these babel builders
priority over the egyptians and that the egyptians were a nation of
masthead standers is an assertion based upon the general belief among
archaeologists that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical
purposes a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stairlike
formation of all four sides of those edifices whereby with prodigious
long upliftings of their legs those old astronomers were wont to mount
to the apex and sing out for new stars even as the lookouts of a
modern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bearing in sight in
saint stylites the famous christian hermit of old times who built him
a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of
his life on its summit hoisting his food from the ground with a
tackle in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless
standerofmastheads who was not to be driven from his place by fogs
or frosts rain hail or sleet but valiantly facing everything out to
the last literally died at his post of modern standersofmastheads
we have but a lifeless set mere stone iron and bronze men who
though well capable of facing out a stiff gale are still entirely
incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange
sight there is napoleon who upon the top of the column of vendome
stands with arms folded some one hundred and fifty feet in the air
careless now who rules the decks below whether louis philippe louis
blanc or louis the devil great washington too stands high aloft on
his towering mainmast in baltimore and like one of hercules pillars
his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals
will go admiral nelson also on a capstan of gunmetal stands his
masthead in trafalgar square and ever when most obscured by that
london smoke token is yet given that a hidden hero is there for
where there is smoke must be fire but neither great washington nor
napoleon nor nelson will answer a single hail from below however
madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks
upon which they gaze however it may be surmised that their spirits
penetrate through the thick haze of the future and descry what shoals
and what rocks must be shunned

it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the masthead
standers of the land with those of the sea but that in truth it is
not so is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy the sole
historian of nantucket stands accountable the worthy obed tells us
that in the early times of the whale fishery ere ships were regularly
launched in pursuit of the game the people of that island erected lofty
spars along the seacoast to which the lookouts ascended by means
of nailed cleats something as fowls go upstairs in a henhouse a few
years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay whalemen of new zealand
who upon descrying the game gave notice to the readymanned boats nigh
the beach but this custom has now become obsolete turn we then to the
one proper masthead that of a whaleship at sea the three mastheads
are kept manned from sunrise to sunset the seamen taking their
regular turns as at the helm and relieving each other every two
hours in the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant
the masthead nay to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful there
you stand a hundred feet above the silent decks striding along the
deep as if the masts were gigantic stilts while beneath you and
between your legs as it were swim the hugest monsters of the sea even
as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous colossus at old
rhodes there you stand lost in the infinite series of the sea with
nothing ruffled but the waves the tranced ship indolently rolls the
drowsy trade winds blow everything resolves you into languor for the
most part in this tropic whaling life a sublime uneventfulness invests
you you hear no news read no gazettes extras with startling accounts
of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements you hear
of no domestic afflictions bankrupt securities fall of stocks are
never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinnerfor
all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks and
your bill of fare is immutable

in one of those southern whalesmen on a long three or four years
voyage as often happens the sum of the various hours you spend at the
masthead would amount to several entire months and it is much to be
deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion
of the whole term of your natural life should be so sadly destitute
of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness or adapted to breed a
comfortable localness of feeling such as pertains to a bed a hammock
a hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach or any other of those small
and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves your
most usual point of perch is the head of the t gallantmast where you
stand upon two thin parallel sticks almost peculiar to whalemen called
the t gallant crosstrees here tossed about by the sea the beginner
feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bulls horns to be sure
in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you in the shape of
a watchcoat but properly speaking the thickest watchcoat is no more
of a house than the unclad body for as the soul is glued inside of its
fleshy tabernacle and cannot freely move about in it nor even move out
of it without running great risk of perishing like an ignorant pilgrim
crossing the snowy alps in winter so a watchcoat is not so much of
a house as it is a mere envelope or additional skin encasing you you
cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body and no more can you
make a convenient closet of your watchcoat

concerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mastheads of a
southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents
or pulpits called crowsnests in which the lookouts of a greenland
whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas in
the fireside narrative of captain sleet entitled a voyage among the
icebergs in quest of the greenland whale and incidentally for the
rediscovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland in
this admirable volume all standers of mastheads are furnished with
a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented
crowsnest of the glacier which was the name of captain sleets good
craft he called it the sleets crowsnest in honour of himself he
being the original inventor and patentee and free from all ridiculous
false delicacy and holding that if we call our own children after our
own names we fathers being the original inventors and patentees so
likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we
may beget in shape the sleets crowsnest is something like a large
tierce or pipe it is open above however where it is furnished with
a movable sidescreen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale
being fixed on the summit of the mast you ascend into it through a
little traphatch in the bottom on the after side or side next the
stern of the ship is a comfortable seat with a locker underneath for
umbrellas comforters and coats in front is a leather rack in which
to keep your speaking trumpet pipe telescope and other nautical
conveniences when captain sleet in person stood his masthead in this
crowsnest of his he tells us that he always had a rifle with him
also fixed in the rack together with a powder flask and shot for
the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales or vagrant sea unicorns
infesting those waters for you cannot successfully shoot at them from
the deck owing to the resistance of the water but to shoot down upon
them is a very different thing now it was plainly a labor of love
for captain sleet to describe as he does all the little detailed
conveniences of his crowsnest but though he so enlarges upon many
of these and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his
experiments in this crowsnest with a small compass he kept there for
the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called
the local attraction of all binnacle magnets an error ascribable to
the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ships planks and in the
glaciers case perhaps to there having been so many brokendown
blacksmiths among her crew i say that though the captain is very
discreet and scientific here yet for all his learned binnacle
deviations azimuth compass observations and approximate errors
he knows very well captain sleet that he was not so much immersed
in those profound magnetic meditations as to fail being attracted
occasionally towards that well replenished little casebottle so nicely
tucked in on one side of his crows nest within easy reach of his hand
though upon the whole i greatly admire and even love the brave the
honest and learned captain yet i take it very ill of him that he
should so utterly ignore that casebottle seeing what a faithful friend
and comforter it must have been while with mittened fingers and hooded
head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that birds nest
within three or four perches of the pole

but if we southern whalefishers are not so snugly housed aloft as
captain sleet and his greenlandmen were yet that disadvantage is
greatly counterbalanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those
seductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float for one i used
to lounge up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top to have a
chat with queequeg or any one else off duty whom i might find there
then ascending a little way further and throwing a lazy leg over the
topsail yard take a preliminary view of the watery pastures and so at
last mount to my ultimate destination

let me make a clean breast of it here and frankly admit that i kept but
sorry guard with the problem of the universe revolving in me how
could ibeing left completely to myself at such a thoughtengendering
altitudehow could i but lightly hold my obligations to observe all
whaleships standing orders keep your weather eye open and sing out
every time

and let me in this place movingly admonish you ye shipowners of
nantucket beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with
lean brow and hollow eye given to unseasonable meditativeness and who
offers to ship with the phaedon instead of bowditch in his head beware
of such an one i say your whales must be seen before they can be
killed and this sunkeneyed young platonist will tow you ten wakes
round the world and never make you one pint of sperm the richer nor
are these monitions at all unneeded for nowadays the whalefishery
furnishes an asylum for many romantic melancholy and absentminded
young men disgusted with the carking cares of earth and seeking
sentiment in tar and blubber childe harold not unfrequently perches
himself upon the masthead of some luckless disappointed whaleship and
in moody phrase ejaculates

roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll ten thousand
blubberhunters sweep over thee in vain

very often do the captains of such ships take those absentminded
young philosophers to task upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient
interest in the voyage halfhinting that they are so hopelessly lost
to all honourable ambition as that in their secret souls they would
rather not see whales than otherwise but all in vain those young
platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect they are
shortsighted what use then to strain the visual nerve they have
left their operaglasses at home

why thou monkey said a harpooneer to one of these lads weve been
cruising now hard upon three years and thou hast not raised a whale
yet whales are scarce as hens teeth whenever thou art up here
perhaps they were or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in
the far horizon but lulled into such an opiumlike listlessness of
vacant unconscious reverie is this absentminded youth by the blending
cadence of waves with thoughts that at last he loses his identity
takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep
blue bottomless soul pervading mankind and nature and every
strange halfseen gliding beautiful thing that eludes him every
dimlydiscovered uprising fin of some undiscernible form seems to him
the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by
continually flitting through it in this enchanted mood thy spirit ebbs
away to whence it came becomes diffused through time and space like
crammers sprinkled pantheistic ashes forming at last a part of every
shore the round globe over

there is no life in thee now except that rocking life imparted by a
gently rolling ship by her borrowed from the sea by the sea from
the inscrutable tides of god but while this sleep this dream is on ye
move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and your identity
comes back in horror over descartian vortices you hover and perhaps
at midday in the fairest weather with one halfthrottled shriek you
drop through that transparent air into the summer sea no more to rise
for ever heed it well ye pantheists



chapter 36 the quarterdeck


enter ahab then all


it was not a great while after the affair of the pipe that one
morning shortly after breakfast ahab as was his wont ascended the
cabingangway to the deck there most seacaptains usually walk at that
hour as country gentlemen after the same meal take a few turns in the
garden

soon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he paced his old
rounds upon planks so familiar to his tread that they were all over
dented like geological stones with the peculiar mark of his walk did
you fixedly gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow there also
you would see still stranger footprintsthe footprints of his one
unsleeping everpacing thought

but on the occasion in question those dents looked deeper even as
his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark and so full of his
thought was ahab that at every uniform turn that he made now at the
mainmast and now at the binnacle you could almost see that thought
turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced so completely
possessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould of every
outer movement

dye mark him flask whispered stubb the chick thats in him pecks
the shell twill soon be out

the hours wore onahab now shut up within his cabin anon pacing the
deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect

it drew near the close of day suddenly he came to a halt by the
bulwarks and inserting his bone leg into the augerhole there and with
one hand grasping a shroud he ordered starbuck to send everybody aft

sir said the mate astonished at an order seldom or never given on
shipboard except in some extraordinary case

send everybody aft repeated ahab mastheads there come down

when the entire ships company were assembled and with curious and not
wholly unapprehensive faces were eyeing him for he looked not unlike
the weather horizon when a storm is coming up ahab after rapidly
glancing over the bulwarks and then darting his eyes among the crew
started from his standpoint and as though not a soul were nigh him
resumed his heavy turns upon the deck with bent head and halfslouched
hat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among
the men till stubb cautiously whispered to flask that ahab must have
summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat but
this did not last long vehemently pausing he cried

what do ye do when ye see a whale men

sing out for him was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed
voices

good cried ahab with a wild approval in his tones observing the
hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically
thrown them

and what do ye next men

lower away and after him

and what tune is it ye pull to men

a dead whale or a stove boat

more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving grew the
countenance of the old man at every shout while the mariners began
to gaze curiously at each other as if marvelling how it was that they
themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions

but they were all eagerness again as ahab now halfrevolving in his
pivothole with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightly almost
convulsively grasping it addressed them thus

all ye mastheaders have before now heard me give orders about a white
whale look ye dye see this spanish ounce of goldholding up a
broad bright coin to the sunit is a sixteen dollar piece men dye
see it mr starbuck hand me yon topmaul

while the mate was getting the hammer ahab without speaking was
slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket as if
to heighten its lustre and without using any words was meanwhile
lowly humming to himself producing a sound so strangely muffled and
inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his
vitality in him

receiving the topmaul from starbuck he advanced towards the mainmast
with the hammer uplifted in one hand exhibiting the gold with the
other and with a high raised voice exclaiming whosoever of ye
raises me a whiteheaded whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw
whosoever of ye raises me that whiteheaded whale with three holes
punctured in his starboard flukelook ye whosoever of ye raises me
that same white whale he shall have this gold ounce my boys

huzza huzza cried the seamen as with swinging tarpaulins they
hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast

its a white whale i say resumed ahab as he threw down the topmaul
a white whale skin your eyes for him men look sharp for white water
if ye see but a bubble sing out

all this while tashtego daggoo and queequeg had looked on with even
more intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mention
of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was
separately touched by some specific recollection

captain ahab said tashtego that white whale must be the same that
some call moby dick

moby dick shouted ahab do ye know the white whale then tash

does he fantail a little curious sir before he goes down said the
gayheader deliberately

and has he a curious spout too said daggoo very bushy even for a
parmacetty and mighty quick captain ahab

and he have one two threeoh good many iron in him hide too
captain cried queequeg disjointedly all twisketee betwisk like
himhim faltering hard for a word and screwing his hand round and
round as though uncorking a bottlelike himhim

corkscrew cried ahab aye queequeg the harpoons lie all twisted
and wrenched in him aye daggoo his spout is a big one like a whole
shock of wheat and white as a pile of our nantucket wool after the
great annual sheepshearing aye tashtego and he fantails like a
split jib in a squall death and devils men it is moby dick ye have
seenmoby dickmoby dick

captain ahab said starbuck who with stubb and flask had thus far
been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at last seemed
struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder captain
ahab i have heard of moby dickbut it was not moby dick that took off
thy leg

who told thee that cried ahab then pausing aye starbuck aye my
hearties all round it was moby dick that dismasted me moby dick that
brought me to this dead stump i stand on now aye aye he shouted with
a terrific loud animal sob like that of a heartstricken moose
aye aye it was that accursed white whale that razeed me made a poor
pegging lubber of me for ever and a day then tossing both arms with
measureless imprecations he shouted out aye aye and ill chase him
round good hope and round the horn and round the norway maelstrom and
round perditions flames before i give him up and this is what ye have
shipped for men to chase that white whale on both sides of land and
over all sides of earth till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out
what say ye men will ye splice hands on it now i think ye do look
brave

aye aye shouted the harpooneers and seamen running closer to the
excited old man a sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance for
moby dick

god bless ye he seemed to half sob and half shout god bless ye
men steward go draw the great measure of grog but whats this long
face about mr starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whale art not
game for moby dick

i am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaws of death too captain
ahab if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow but i
came here to hunt whales not my commanders vengeance how many barrels
will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it captain ahab it
will not fetch thee much in our nantucket market

nantucket market hoot but come closer starbuck thou requirest
a little lower layer if moneys to be the measurer man and the
accountants have computed their great countinghouse the globe by
girdling it with guineas one to every three parts of an inch then let
me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here

he smites his chest whispered stubb whats that for methinks it
rings most vast but hollow

vengeance on a dumb brute cried starbuck that simply smote thee
from blindest instinct madness to be enraged with a dumb thing
captain ahab seems blasphemous

hark ye yet againthe little lower layer all visible objects man
are but as pasteboard masks but in each eventin the living act the
undoubted deedthere some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth
the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask if man
will strike strike through the mask how can the prisoner reach outside
except by thrusting through the wall to me the white whale is that
wall shoved near to me sometimes i think theres naught beyond but
tis enough he tasks me he heaps me i see in him outrageous strength
with an inscrutable malice sinewing it that inscrutable thing is
chiefly what i hate and be the white whale agent or be the white whale
principal i will wreak that hate upon him talk not to me of blasphemy
man id strike the sun if it insulted me for could the sun do that
then could i do the other since there is ever a sort of fair play
herein jealousy presiding over all creations but not my master man
is even that fair play whos over me truth hath no confines take off
thine eye more intolerable than fiends glarings is a doltish
stare so so thou reddenest and palest my heat has melted thee to
angerglow but look ye starbuck what is said in heat that thing
unsays itself there are men from whom warm words are small indignity i
meant not to incense thee let it go look see yonder turkish cheeks of
spotted tawnliving breathing pictures painted by the sun the pagan
leopardsthe unrecking and unworshipping things that live and seek
and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel the crew man the
crew are they not one and all with ahab in this matter of the whale
see stubb he laughs see yonder chilian he snorts to think of it
stand up amid the general hurricane thy one tost sapling cannot
starbuck and what is it reckon it tis but to help strike a fin no
wondrous feat for starbuck what is it more from this one poor hunt
then the best lance out of all nantucket surely he will not hang back
when every foremasthand has clutched a whetstone ah constrainings
seize thee i see the billow lifts thee speak but speakaye aye
thy silence then that voices thee aside something shot from my
dilated nostrils he has inhaled it in his lungs starbuck now is mine
cannot oppose me now without rebellion

god keep mekeep us all murmured starbuck lowly

but in his joy at the enchanted tacit acquiescence of the mate ahab
did not hear his foreboding invocation nor yet the low laugh from the
hold nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage
nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts as for a moment
their hearts sank in for again starbucks downcast eyes lighted up with
the stubbornness of life the subterranean laugh died away the winds
blew on the sails filled out the ship heaved and rolled as before ah
ye admonitions and warnings why stay ye not when ye come but
rather are ye predictions than warnings ye shadows yet not so much
predictions from without as verifications of the foregoing things
within for with little external to constrain us the innermost
necessities in our being these still drive us on

the measure the measure cried ahab

receiving the brimming pewter and turning to the harpooneers he
ordered them to produce their weapons then ranging them before him near
the capstan with their harpoons in their hands while his three mates
stood at his side with their lances and the rest of the ships company
formed a circle round the group he stood for an instant searchingly
eyeing every man of his crew but those wild eyes met his as the
bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader ere
he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison but alas only to
fall into the hidden snare of the indian

drink and pass he cried handing the heavy charged flagon to the
nearest seaman the crew alone now drink round with it round short
draughtslong swallows men tis hot as satans hoof so so it
goes round excellently it spiralizes in ye forks out at the
serpentsnapping eye well done almost drained that way it went this
way it comes hand it meheres a hollow men ye seem the years so
brimming life is gulped and gone steward refill

attend now my braves i have mustered ye all round this capstan and
ye mates flank me with your lances and ye harpooneers stand there
with your irons and ye stout mariners ring me in that i may in some
sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me o men you
will yet see thatha boy come back bad pennies come not sooner hand
it me why now this pewter had run brimming again weret not thou st
vitus impaway thou ague

advance ye mates cross your lances full before me well done let
me touch the axis so saying with extended arm he grasped the
three level radiating lances at their crossed centre while so doing
suddenly and nervously twitched them meanwhile glancing intently from
starbuck to stubb from stubb to flask it seemed as though by some
nameless interior volition he would fain have shocked into them the
same fiery emotion accumulated within the leyden jar of his own magnetic
life the three mates quailed before his strong sustained and mystic
aspect stubb and flask looked sideways from him the honest eye of
starbuck fell downright

in vain cried ahab but maybe tis well for did ye three but
once take the fullforced shock then mine own electric thing that had
perhaps expired from out me perchance too it would have dropped ye
dead perchance ye need it not down lances and now ye mates i do
appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen thereyon three
most honourable gentlemen and noblemen my valiant harpooneers disdain
the task what when the great pope washes the feet of beggars using
his tiara for ewer oh my sweet cardinals your own condescension that
shall bend ye to it i do not order ye ye will it cut your seizings
and draw the poles ye harpooneers

silently obeying the order the three harpooneers now stood with the
detached iron part of their harpoons some three feet long held barbs
up before him

stab me not with that keen steel cant them cant them over know ye
not the goblet end turn up the socket so so now ye cupbearers
advance the irons take them hold them while i fill forthwith
slowly going from one officer to the other he brimmed the harpoon
sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter

now three to three ye stand commend the murderous chalices bestow
them ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league ha
starbuck but the deed is done yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon
it drink ye harpooneers drink and swear ye men that man the deathful
whaleboats bowdeath to moby dick god hunt us all if we do not hunt
moby dick to his death the long barbed steel goblets were lifted
and to cries and maledictions against the white whale the spirits were
simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss starbuck paled and turned and
shivered once more and finally the replenished pewter went the rounds
among the frantic crew when waving his free hand to them they all
dispersed and ahab retired within his cabin



chapter 37 sunset


the cabin by the stern windows ahab sitting alone and gazing out


i leave a white and turbid wake pale waters paler cheeks whereer i
sail the envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track let them
but first i pass

yonder by everbrimming goblets rim the warm waves blush like wine
the gold brow plumbs the blue the diver sunslow dived from noongoes
down my soul mounts up she wearies with her endless hill is then
the crown too heavy that i wear this iron crown of lombardy yet is
it bright with many a gem i the wearer see not its far flashings but
darkly feel that i wear that that dazzlingly confounds tis ironthat
i knownot gold tis split toothat i feel the jagged edge galls
me so my brain seems to beat against the solid metal aye steel skull
mine the sort that needs no helmet in the most brainbattering fight

dry heat upon my brow oh time was when as the sunrise nobly spurred
me so the sunset soothed no more this lovely light it lights not me
all loveliness is anguish to me since i can neer enjoy gifted with
the high perception i lack the low enjoying power damned most subtly
and most malignantly damned in the midst of paradise good nightgood
night waving his hand he moves from the window

twas not so hard a task i thought to find one stubborn at the least
but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels and they
revolve or if you will like so many anthills of powder they all
stand before me and i their match oh hard that to fire others the
match itself must needs be wasting what ive dared ive willed and
what ive willed ill do they think me madstarbuck does but im
demoniac i am madness maddened that wild madness thats only calm
to comprehend itself the prophecy was that i should be dismembered
andaye i lost this leg i now prophesy that i will dismember my
dismemberer now then be the prophet and the fulfiller one thats
more than ye ye great gods ever were i laugh and hoot at ye ye
cricketplayers ye pugilists ye deaf burkes and blinded bendigoes
i will not say as schoolboys do to bulliestake some one of your own
size dont pommel me no yeve knocked me down and i am up again but
ye have run and hidden come forth from behind your cotton bags i have
no long gun to reach ye come ahabs compliments to ye come and see
if ye can swerve me swerve me ye cannot swerve me else ye swerve
yourselves man has ye there swerve me the path to my fixed purpose is
laid with iron rails whereon my soul is grooved to run over unsounded
gorges through the rifled hearts of mountains under torrents beds
unerringly i rush naughts an obstacle naughts an angle to the iron
way



chapter 38 dusk


by the mainmast starbuck leaning against it


my soul is more than matched shes overmanned and by a madman
insufferable sting that sanity should ground arms on such a field but
he drilled deep down and blasted all my reason out of me i think i see
his impious end but feel that i must help him to it will i nill i
the ineffable thing has tied me to him tows me with a cable i have no
knife to cut horrible old man whos over him he criesaye he would
be a democrat to all above look how he lords it over all below oh i
plainly see my miserable officeto obey rebelling and worse yet
to hate with touch of pity for in his eyes i read some lurid woe would
shrivel me up had i it yet is there hope time and tide flow wide
the hated whale has the round watery world to swim in as the small
goldfish has its glassy globe his heaveninsulting purpose god may
wedge aside i would up heart were it not like lead but my whole
clocks run down my heart the allcontrolling weight i have no key to
lift again


a burst of revelry from the forecastle


oh god to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human
mothers in them whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea the white whale
is their demigorgon hark the infernal orgies that revelry is forward
mark the unfaltering silence aft methinks it pictures life foremost
through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay embattled bantering
bow but only to drag dark ahab after it where he broods within his
sternward cabin builded over the dead water of the wake and further
on hunted by its wolfish gurglings the long howl thrills me through
peace ye revellers and set the watch oh life tis in an hour like
this with soul beat down and held to knowledgeas wild untutored
things are forced to feedoh life tis now that i do feel the latent
horror in thee but tis not me that horrors out of me and with the
soft feeling of the human in me yet will i try to fight ye ye grim
phantom futures stand by me hold me bind me o ye blessed influences

chapter 41 moby dick


i ishmael was one of that crew my shouts had gone up with the rest
my oath had been welded with theirs and stronger i shouted and more
did i hammer and clinch my oath because of the dread in my soul a
wild mystical sympathetical feeling was in me ahabs quenchless feud
seemed mine with greedy ears i learned the history of that murderous
monster against whom i and all the others had taken our oaths of
violence and revenge

for some time past though at intervals only the unaccompanied
secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly
frequented by the sperm whale fishermen but not all of them knew of his
existence only a few of them comparatively had knowingly seen him
while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to
him was small indeed for owing to the large number of whalecruisers
the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery
circumference many of them adventurously pushing their quest along
solitary latitudes so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or
more on a stretch to encounter a single newstelling sail of any sort
the inordinate length of each separate voyage the irregularity of the
times of sailing from home all these with other circumstances direct
and indirect long obstructed the spread through the whole worldwide
whalingfleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning moby
dick it was hardly to be doubted that several vessels reported to have
encountered at such or such a time or on such or such a meridian
a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity which whale after
doing great mischief to his assailants had completely escaped them to
some minds it was not an unfair presumption i say that the whale in
question must have been no other than moby dick yet as of late the
sperm whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent
instances of great ferocity cunning and malice in the monster
attacked therefore it was that those who by accident ignorantly gave
battle to moby dick such hunters perhaps for the most part were
content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred more as it were to
the perils of the sperm whale fishery at large than to the individual
cause in that way mostly the disastrous encounter between ahab and
the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded

and as for those who previously hearing of the white whale by chance
caught sight of him in the beginning of the thing they had every one of
them almost as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him as for any other
whale of that species but at length such calamities did ensue in these
assaultsnot restricted to sprained wrists and ankles broken limbs or
devouring amputationsbut fatal to the last degree of fatality those
repeated disastrous repulses all accumulating and piling their terrors
upon moby dick those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many
brave hunters to whom the story of the white whale had eventually come

nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate and still the more
horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters for not only do
fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising
terrible eventsas the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi but in
maritime life far more than in that of terra firma wild rumors abound
wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to and as the
sea surpasses the land in this matter so the whale fishery surpasses
every other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness and fearfulness
of the rumors which sometimes circulate there for not only are whalemen
as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary
to all sailors but of all sailors they are by all odds the most
directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing
in the sea face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels but
hand to jaw give battle to them alone in such remotest waters that
though you sailed a thousand miles and passed a thousand shores you
would not come to any chiseled hearthstone or aught hospitable beneath
that part of the sun in such latitudes and longitudes pursuing too
such a calling as he does the whaleman is wrapped by influences all
tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth

no wonder then that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over
the widest watery spaces the outblown rumors of the white whale did
in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints
and halfformed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies which
eventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything
that visibly appears so that in many cases such a panic did he finally
strike that few who by those rumors at least had heard of the white
whale few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his
jaw

but there were still other and more vital practical influences at work
not even at the present day has the original prestige of the sperm
whale as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the
leviathan died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body there are
those this day among them who though intelligent and courageous
enough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale would
perhapseither from professional inexperience or incompetency or
timidity decline a contest with the sperm whale at any rate there are
plenty of whalemen especially among those whaling nations not sailing
under the american flag who have never hostilely encountered the sperm
whale but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to
the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north seated on their
hatches these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest
and awe to the wild strange tales of southern whaling nor is the
preeminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more
feelingly comprehended than on board of those prows which stem him

and as if the now tested reality of his might had in former
legendary times thrown its shadow before it we find some book
naturalistsolassen and povelsondeclaring the sperm whale not only to
be a consternation to every other creature in the sea but also to be so
incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood nor
even down to so late a time as cuviers were these or almost similar
impressions effaced for in his natural history the baron himself
affirms that at sight of the sperm whale all fish sharks included are
struck with the most lively terrors and often in the precipitancy of
their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to
cause instantaneous death and however the general experiences in the
fishery may amend such reports as these yet in their full terribleness
even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson the superstitious belief in
them is in some vicissitudes of their vocation revived in the minds of
the hunters

so that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him not a few of
the fishermen recalled in reference to moby dick the earlier days
of the sperm whale fishery when it was oftentimes hard to induce long
practised right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring
warfare such men protesting that although other leviathans might be
hopefully pursued yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition
as the sperm whale was not for mortal man that to attempt it would
be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity on this head there are
some remarkable documents that may be consulted

nevertheless some there were who even in the face of these things
were ready to give chase to moby dick and a still greater number who
chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely without the
specific details of any certain calamity and without superstitious
accompaniments were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if
offered

one of the wild suggestions referred to as at last coming to be linked
with the white whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined
was the unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous that he had
actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same
instant of time

nor credulous as such minds must have been was this conceit altogether
without some faint show of superstitious probability for as the secrets
of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged even to
the most erudite research so the hidden ways of the sperm whale
when beneath the surface remain in great part unaccountable to his
pursuers and from time to time have originated the most curious and
contradictory speculations regarding them especially concerning the
mystic modes whereby after sounding to a great depth he transports
himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points

it is a thing well known to both american and english whaleships and
as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by scoresby
that some whales have been captured far north in the pacific in whose
bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenland
seas nor is it to be gainsaid that in some of these instances it has
been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could
not have exceeded very many days hence by inference it has been
believed by some whalemen that the nor west passage so long a problem
to man was never a problem to the whale so that here in the real
living experience of living men the prodigies related in old times of
the inland strello mountain in portugal near whose top there was said
to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface
and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near
syracuse whose waters were believed to have come from the holy land
by an underground passage these fabulous narrations are almost fully
equalled by the realities of the whalemen

forced into familiarity then with such prodigies as these and knowing
that after repeated intrepid assaults the white whale had escaped
alive it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should
go still further in their superstitions declaring moby dick not only
ubiquitous but immortal for immortality is but ubiquity in time that
though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks he would still
swim away unharmed or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick
blood such a sight would be but a ghastly deception for again in
unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away his unsullied jet would
once more be seen

but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings there was enough in
the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike
the imagination with unwonted power for it was not so much his
uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales
but as was elsewhere thrown outa peculiar snowwhite wrinkled
forehead and a high pyramidical white hump these were his prominent
features the tokens whereby even in the limitless uncharted seas he
revealed his identity at a long distance to those who knew him

the rest of his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled with
the same shrouded hue that in the end he had gained his distinctive
appellation of the white whale a name indeed literally justified by
his vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue
sea leaving a milkyway wake of creamy foam all spangled with golden
gleamings

nor was it his unwonted magnitude nor his remarkable hue nor yet his
deformed lower jaw that so much invested the whale with natural terror
as that unexampled intelligent malignity which according to specific
accounts he had over and over again evinced in his assaults more than
all his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught
else for when swimming before his exulting pursuers with every
apparent symptom of alarm he had several times been known to turn
round suddenly and bearing down upon them either stave their boats to
splinters or drive them back in consternation to their ship

already several fatalities had attended his chase but though similar
disasters however little bruited ashore were by no means unusual
in the fishery yet in most instances such seemed the white whales
infernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or death
that he caused was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an
unintelligent agent

judge then to what pitches of inflamed distracted fury the minds of
his more desperate hunters were impelled when amid the chips of chewed
boats and the sinking limbs of torn comrades they swam out of the
white curds of the whales direful wrath into the serene exasperating
sunlight that smiled on as if at a birth or a bridal

his three boats stove around him and oars and men both whirling in the
eddies one captain seizing the lineknife from his broken prow had
dashed at the whale as an arkansas duellist at his foe blindly seeking
with a six inch blade to reach the fathomdeep life of the whale
that captain was ahab and then it was that suddenly sweeping his
sickleshaped lower jaw beneath him moby dick had reaped away ahabs
leg as a mower a blade of grass in the field no turbaned turk no
hired venetian or malay could have smote him with more seeming malice
small reason was there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal
encounter ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale
all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came
to identify with him not only all his bodily woes but all his
intellectual and spiritual exasperations the white whale swam before
him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which
some deep men feel eating in them till they are left living on with
half a heart and half a lung that intangible malignity which has been
from the beginning to whose dominion even the modern christians ascribe
onehalf of the worlds which the ancient ophites of the east reverenced
in their statue devilahab did not fall down and worship it like them
but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale he
pitted himself all mutilated against it all that most maddens and
torments all that stirs up the lees of things all truth with malice
in it all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain all the subtle
demonisms of life and thought all evil to crazy ahab were visibly
personified and made practically assailable in moby dick he piled upon
the whales white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt
by his whole race from adam down and then as if his chest had been a
mortar he burst his hot hearts shell upon it

it is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at
the precise time of his bodily dismemberment then in darting at the
monster knife in hand he had but given loose to a sudden passionate
corporal animosity and when he received the stroke that tore him he
probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration but nothing more
yet when by this collision forced to turn towards home and for long
months of days and weeks ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one
hammock rounding in mid winter that dreary howling patagonian cape
then it was that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another
and so interfusing made him mad that it was only then on the homeward
voyage after the encounter that the final monomania seized him seems
all but certain from the fact that at intervals during the passage
he was a raving lunatic and though unlimbed of a leg yet such vital
strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest and was moreover intensified
by his delirium that his mates were forced to lace him fast even
there as he sailed raving in his hammock in a straitjacket he swung
to the mad rockings of the gales and when running into more sufferable
latitudes the ship with mild stunsails spread floated across the
tranquil tropics and to all appearances the old mans delirium seemed
left behind him with the cape horn swells and he came forth from his
dark den into the blessed light and air even then when he bore that
firm collected front however pale and issued his calm orders once
again and his mates thanked god the direful madness was now gone even
then ahab in his hidden self raved on human madness is oftentimes a
cunning and most feline thing when you think it fled it may have but
become transfigured into some still subtler form ahabs full lunacy
subsided not but deepeningly contracted like the unabated hudson
when that noble northman flows narrowly but unfathomably through the
highland gorge but as in his narrowflowing monomania not one jot of
ahabs broad madness had been left behind so in that broad madness not
one jot of his great natural intellect had perished that before living
agent now became the living instrument if such a furious trope may
stand his special lunacy stormed his general sanity and carried it
and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark so that far
from having lost his strength ahab to that one end did now possess a
thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon
any one reasonable object

this is much yet ahabs larger darker deeper part remains unhinted
but vain to popularize profundities and all truth is profound winding
far down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny where
we here standhowever grand and wonderful now quit itand take your
way ye nobler sadder souls to those vast roman halls of thermes
where far beneath the fantastic towers of mans upper earth his root
of grandeur his whole awful essence sits in bearded state an antique
buried beneath antiquities and throned on torsoes so with a broken
throne the great gods mock that captive king so like a caryatid he
patient sits upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of
ages wind ye down there ye prouder sadder souls question that proud
sad king a family likeness aye he did beget ye ye young exiled
royalties and from your grim sire only will the old statesecret come

now in his heart ahab had some glimpse of this namely all my means
are sane my motive and my object mad yet without power to kill or
change or shun the fact he likewise knew that to mankind he did long
dissemble in some sort did still but that thing of his dissembling
was only subject to his perceptibility not to his will determinate
nevertheless so well did he succeed in that dissembling that when
with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last no nantucketer thought him
otherwise than but naturally grieved and that to the quick with the
terrible casualty which had overtaken him

the report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
ascribed to a kindred cause and so too all the added moodiness which
always afterwards to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the
present voyage sat brooding on his brow nor is it so very unlikely
that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage on
account of such dark symptoms the calculating people of that prudent
isle were inclined to harbor the conceit that for those very reasons he
was all the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuit so full
of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales gnawed within and
scorched without with the infixed unrelenting fangs of some incurable
idea such an one could he be found would seem the very man to dart
his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes
or if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that
yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on
his underlings to the attack but be all this as it may certain it is
that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in
him ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only
and allengrossing object of hunting the white whale had any one of his
old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him
then how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the
ship from such a fiendish man they were bent on profitable cruises the
profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint he was intent on an
audacious immitigable and supernatural revenge

here then was this greyheaded ungodly old man chasing with curses a
jobs whale round the world at the head of a crew too chiefly made
up of mongrel renegades and castaways and cannibalsmorally enfeebled
also by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or rightmindedness in
starbuck the invunerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in
stubb and the pervading mediocrity in flask such a crew so officered
seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him
to his monomaniac revenge how it was that they so aboundingly responded
to the old mans ireby what evil magic their souls were possessed
that at times his hate seemed almost theirs the white whale as much
their insufferable foe as his how all this came to bewhat the white
whale was to them or how to their unconscious understandings also in
some dim unsuspected way he might have seemed the gliding great demon
of the seas of lifeall this to explain would be to dive deeper than
ishmael can go the subterranean miner that works in us all how can one
tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting muffled sound of his
pick who does not feel the irresistible arm drag what skiff in tow
of a seventyfour can stand still for one i gave myself up to the
abandonment of the time and the place but while yet all arush to
encounter the whale could see naught in that brute but the deadliest
ill



chapter 42 the whiteness of the whale


what the white whale was to ahab has been hinted what at times he
was to me as yet remains unsaid

aside from those more obvious considerations touching moby dick which
could not but occasionally awaken in any mans soul some alarm there
was another thought or rather vague nameless horror concerning him
which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest and
yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it that i almost despair of
putting it in a comprehensible form it was the whiteness of the whale
that above all things appalled me but how can i hope to explain myself
here and yet in some dim random way explain myself i must else all
these chapters might be naught

though in many natural objects whiteness refiningly enhances beauty as
if imparting some special virtue of its own as in marbles japonicas
and pearls and though various nations have in some way recognised a
certain royal preeminence in this hue even the barbaric grand old
kings of pegu placing the title lord of the white elephants above all
their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion and the modern kings
of siam unfurling the same snowwhite quadruped in the royal standard
and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snowwhite charger
and the great austrian empire caesarian heir to overlording rome
having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue and though this
preeminence in it applies to the human race itself giving the white
man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe and though besides all
this whiteness has been even made significant of gladness for among
the romans a white stone marked a joyful day and though in other mortal
sympathies and symbolizings this same hue is made the emblem of many
touching noble thingsthe innocence of brides the benignity of age
though among the red men of america the giving of the white belt
of wampum was the deepest pledge of honour though in many climes
whiteness typifies the majesty of justice in the ermine of the judge
and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by
milkwhite steeds though even in the higher mysteries of the most
august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness
and power by the persian fire worshippers the white forked flame being
held the holiest on the altar and in the greek mythologies great jove
himself being made incarnate in a snowwhite bull and though to the
noble iroquois the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred white dog was
by far the holiest festival of their theology that spotless faithful
creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the great spirit
with the annual tidings of their own fidelity and though directly from
the latin word for white all christian priests derive the name of
one part of their sacred vesture the alb or tunic worn beneath the
cassock and though among the holy pomps of the romish faith white is
specially employed in the celebration of the passion of our lord though
in the vision of st john white robes are given to the redeemed and
the fourandtwenty elders stand clothed in white before the greatwhite
throne and the holy one that sitteth there white like wool yet for all
these accumulated associations with whatever is sweet and honourable
and sublime there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea
of this hue which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness
which affrights in blood

this elusive quality it is which causes the thought of whiteness when
divorced from more kindly associations and coupled with any object
terrible in itself to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds
witness the white bear of the poles and the white shark of the tropics
what but their smooth flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent
horrors they are that ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an
abhorrent mildness even more loathsome than terrific to the dumb
gloating of their aspect so that not the fiercefanged tiger in his
heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the whiteshrouded bear or
shark


with reference to the polar bear it may possibly be urged by him
who would fain go still deeper into this matter that it is not
the whiteness separately regarded which heightens the intolerable
hideousness of that brute for analysed that heightened hideousness
it might be said only rises from the circumstance that the
irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the
fleece of celestial innocence and love and hence by bringing together
two such opposite emotions in our minds the polar bear frightens us
with so unnatural a contrast but even assuming all this to be true
yet were it not for the whiteness you would not have that intensified
terror

as for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that
creature when beheld in his ordinary moods strangely tallies with the
same quality in the polar quadruped this peculiarity is most vividly
hit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish the romish
mass for the dead begins with requiem eternam eternal rest whence
requiem denominating the mass itself and any other funeral music now
in allusion to the white silent stillness of death in this shark and
the mild deadliness of his habits the french call him requin


bethink thee of the albatross whence come those clouds of spiritual
wonderment and pale dread in which that white phantom sails in all
imaginations not coleridge first threw that spell but gods great
unflattering laureate nature


i remember the first albatross i ever saw it was during a prolonged
gale in waters hard upon the antarctic seas from my forenoon watch
below i ascended to the overclouded deck and there dashed upon the
main hatches i saw a regal feathery thing of unspotted whiteness and
with a hooked roman bill sublime at intervals it arched forth
its vast archangel wings as if to embrace some holy ark wondrous
flutterings and throbbings shook it though bodily unharmed it uttered
cries as some kings ghost in supernatural distress through its
inexpressible strange eyes methought i peeped to secrets which took
hold of god as abraham before the angels i bowed myself the white
thing was so white its wings so wide and in those for ever exiled
waters i had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of
towns long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage i cannot tell can only
hint the things that darted through me then but at last i awoke and
turning asked a sailor what bird was this a goney he replied goney
never had heard that name before is it conceivable that this glorious
thing is utterly unknown to men ashore never but some time after i
learned that goney was some seamans name for albatross so that by no
possibility could coleridges wild rhyme have had aught to do with those
mystical impressions which were mine when i saw that bird upon our
deck for neither had i then read the rhyme nor knew the bird to be
an albatross yet in saying this i do but indirectly burnish a little
brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet

i assert then that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird
chiefly lurks the secret of the spell a truth the more evinced in this
that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses
and these i have frequently seen but never with such emotions as when i
beheld the antarctic fowl

but how had the mystic thing been caught whisper it not and i will
tell with a treacherous hook and line as the fowl floated on the sea
at last the captain made a postman of it tying a lettered leathern
tally round its neck with the ships time and place and then letting
it escape but i doubt not that leathern tally meant for man was
taken off in heaven when the white fowl flew to join the wingfolding
the invoking and adoring cherubim


most famous in our western annals and indian traditions is that of
the white steed of the prairies a magnificent milkwhite charger
largeeyed smallheaded bluffchested and with the dignity of a
thousand monarchs in his lofty overscorning carriage he was the
elected xerxes of vast herds of wild horses whose pastures in those
days were only fenced by the rocky mountains and the alleghanies at
their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which
every evening leads on the hosts of light the flashing cascade of his
mane the curving comet of his tail invested him with housings more
resplendent than gold and silverbeaters could have furnished him a
most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen western
world which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the
glories of those primeval times when adam walked majestic as a god
bluffbrowed and fearless as this mighty steed whether marching amid
his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly
streamed it over the plains like an ohio or whether with his
circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon the white
steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his
cool milkiness in whatever aspect he presented himself always to the
bravest indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe nor
can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble
horse that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly which so clothed him
with divineness and that this divineness had that in it which though
commanding worship at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror

but there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that
accessory and strange glory which invests it in the white steed and
albatross

what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks
the eye as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin it
is that whiteness which invests him a thing expressed by the name
he bears the albino is as well made as other menhas no substantive
deformityand yet this mere aspect of allpervading whiteness makes him
more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion why should this be so

nor in quite other aspects does nature in her least palpable but
not the less malicious agencies fail to enlist among her forces
this crowning attribute of the terrible from its snowy aspect the
gauntleted ghost of the southern seas has been denominated the white
squall nor in some historic instances has the art of human malice
omitted so potent an auxiliary how wildly it heightens the effect of
that passage in froissart when masked in the snowy symbol of their
faction the desperate white hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in the
marketplace

nor in some things does the common hereditary experience of all
mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue it
cannot well be doubted that the one visible quality in the aspect of
the dead which most appals the gazer is the marble pallor lingering
there as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of
consternation in the other world as of mortal trepidation here and
from that pallor of the dead we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud
in which we wrap them nor even in our superstitions do we fail to
throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms all ghosts rising in a
milkwhite fogyea while these terrors seize us let us add that even
the king of terrors when personified by the evangelist rides on his
pallid horse

therefore in his other moods symbolize whatever grand or gracious
thing he will by whiteness no man can deny that in its profoundest
idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul

but though without dissent this point be fixed how is mortal man to
account for it to analyse it would seem impossible can we then
by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of
whitenessthough for the time either wholly or in great part stripped
of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful
but nevertheless is found to exert over us the same sorcery however
modifiedcan we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us
to the hidden cause we seek

let us try but in a matter like this subtlety appeals to subtlety
and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls and
though doubtless some at least of the imaginative impressions about
to be presented may have been shared by most men yet few perhaps were
entirely conscious of them at the time and therefore may not be able to
recall them now

why to the man of untutored ideality who happens to be but loosely
acquainted with the peculiar character of the day does the bare mention
of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long dreary speechless
processions of slowpacing pilgrims downcast and hooded with
newfallen snow or to the unread unsophisticated protestant of the
middle american states why does the passing mention of a white friar or
a white nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul

or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and
kings which will not wholly account for it that makes the white
tower of london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of
an untravelled american than those other storied structures its
neighborsthe byward tower or even the bloody and those sublimer
towers the white mountains of new hampshire whence in peculiar moods
comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of
that name while the thought of virginias blue ridge is full of a soft
dewy distant dreaminess or why irrespective of all latitudes and
longitudes does the name of the white sea exert such a spectralness
over the fancy while that of the yellow sea lulls us with mortal
thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves followed by
the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets or to choose a wholly
unsubstantial instance purely addressed to the fancy why in reading
the old fairy tales of central europe does the tall pale man of the
hartz forests whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the
green of the groveswhy is this phantom more terrible than all the
whooping imps of the blocksburg

nor is it altogether the remembrance of her cathedraltoppling
earthquakes nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas nor the
tearlessness of arid skies that never rain nor the sight of her wide
field of leaning spires wrenched copestones and crosses all adroop
like canted yards of anchored fleets and her suburban avenues of
housewalls lying over upon each other as a tossed pack of cardsit
is not these things alone which make tearless lima the strangest
saddest city thou canst see for lima has taken the white veil and
there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe old as pizarro
this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new admits not the cheerful
greenness of complete decay spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid
pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions

i know that to the common apprehension this phenomenon of whiteness
is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of
objects otherwise terrible nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught
of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost
solely consists in this one phenomenon especially when exhibited under
any form at all approaching to muteness or universality what i mean
by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the
following examples

first the mariner when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands if by
night he hear the roar of breakers starts to vigilance and feels just
enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties but under precisely
similar circumstances let him be called from his hammock to view his
ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whitenessas if from
encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round
him then he feels a silent superstitious dread the shrouded phantom
of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost in vain the
lead assures him he is still off soundings heart and helm they both go
down he never rests till blue water is under him again yet where is
the mariner who will tell thee sir it was not so much the fear of
striking hidden rocks as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so
stirred me

second to the native indian of peru the continual sight of the
snowhowdahed andes conveys naught of dread except perhaps in the
mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast
altitudes and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be
to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes much the same is it with the
backwoodsman of the west who with comparative indifference views an
unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow no shadow of tree or twig
to break the fixed trance of whiteness not so the sailor beholding the
scenery of the antarctic seas where at times by some infernal trick
of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air he shivering and half
shipwrecked instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery
views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean
ice monuments and splintered crosses

but thou sayest methinks that whitelead chapter about whiteness is but
a white flag hung out from a craven soul thou surrenderest to a hypo
ishmael

tell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peaceful valley of
vermont far removed from all beasts of preywhy is it that upon the
sunniest day if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him so that
he cannot even see it but only smells its wild animal muskinesswhy
will he start snort and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies
of affright there is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild
creatures in his green northern home so that the strange muskiness he
smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of
former perils for what knows he this new england colt of the black
bisons of distant oregon

no but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute the instinct of the
knowledge of the demonism in the world though thousands of miles from
oregon still when he smells that savage musk the rending goring bison
herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies which
this instant they may be trampling into dust

thus then the muffled rollings of a milky sea the bleak rustlings
of the festooned frosts of mountains the desolate shiftings of the
windrowed snows of prairies all these to ishmael are as the shaking
of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt

though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic
sign gives forth such hints yet with me as with the colt somewhere
those things must exist though in many of its aspects this visible
world seems formed in love the invisible spheres were formed in fright

but not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness and
learned why it appeals with such power to the soul and more strange
and far more portentouswhy as we have seen it is at once the
most meaning symbol of spiritual things nay the very veil of the
christians deity and yet should be as it is the intensifying agent in
things the most appalling to mankind

is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids
and immensities of the universe and thus stabs us from behind with the
thought of annihilation when beholding the white depths of the milky
way or is it that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as
the visible absence of colour and at the same time the concrete of all
colours is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness
full of meaning in a wide landscape of snowsa colourless allcolour
of atheism from which we shrink and when we consider that other theory
of the natural philosophers that all other earthly huesevery stately
or lovely emblazoningthe sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods yea
and the gilded velvets of butterflies and the butterfly cheeks of
young girls all these are but subtile deceits not actually inherent
in substances but only laid on from without so that all deified nature
absolutely paints like the harlot whose allurements cover nothing but
the charnelhouse within and when we proceed further and consider that
the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues the great
principle of light for ever remains white or colourless in itself and
if operating without medium upon matter would touch all objects even
tulips and roses with its own blank tingepondering all this the
palsied universe lies before us a leper and like wilful travellers in
lapland who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their
eyes so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental
white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him and of all these
things the albino whale was the symbol wonder ye then at the fiery
hunt



chapter 43 hark


hist did you hear that noise cabaco

it was the middlewatch a fair moonlight the seamen were standing in a
cordon extending from one of the freshwater butts in the waist to the
scuttlebutt near the taffrail in this manner they passed the buckets
to fill the scuttlebutt standing for the most part on the hallowed
precincts of the quarterdeck they were careful not to speak or rustle
their feet from hand to hand the buckets went in the deepest silence
only broken by the occasional flap of a sail and the steady hum of the
unceasingly advancing keel

it was in the midst of this repose that archy one of the cordon whose
post was near the afterhatches whispered to his neighbor a cholo the
words above

chapter 44 the chart


had you followed captain ahab down into his cabin after the squall that
took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose
with his crew you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom
and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts spread
them before him on his screweddown table then seating himself before
it you would have seen him intently study the various lines and
shadings which there met his eye and with slow but steady pencil trace
additional courses over spaces that before were blank at intervals he
would refer to piles of old logbooks beside him wherein were set down
the seasons and places in which on various former voyages of various
ships sperm whales had been captured or seen

while thus employed the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his
head continually rocked with the motion of the ship and for ever threw
shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow till it
almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses
on the wrinkled charts some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and
courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead

but it was not this night in particular that in the solitude of his
cabin ahab thus pondered over his charts almost every night they were
brought out almost every night some pencil marks were effaced and
others were substituted for with the charts of all four oceans before
him ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies with a view to
the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul

now to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans
it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet but not so did it
seem to ahab who knew the sets of all tides and currents and thereby
calculating the driftings of the sperm whales food and also calling
to mind the regular ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular
latitudes could arrive at reasonable surmises almost approaching to
certainties concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground
in search of his prey

so assured indeed is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the
sperm whales resorting to given waters that many hunters believe that
could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world were the
logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated
then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in
invariability to those of the herringshoals or the flights of swallows
on this hint attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory
charts of the sperm whale

     since the above was written the statement is happily borne
     out by an official circular issued by lieutenant maury of
     the national observatory washington april 16th 1851 by
     that circular it appears that precisely such a chart is in
     course of completion and portions of it are presented in
     the circular this chart divides the ocean into districts
     of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude
     perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve
     columns for the twelve months and horizontally through each
     of which districts are three lines one to show the number
     of days that have been spent in each month in every
     district and the two others to show the number of days in
     which whales sperm or right have been seen

besides when making a passage from one feedingground to another the
sperm whales guided by some infallible instinctsay rather secret
intelligence from the deitymostly swim in veins as they are called
continuing their way along a given oceanline with such undeviating
exactitude that no ship ever sailed her course by any chart with
one tithe of such marvellous precision though in these cases the
direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyors parallel
and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own
unavoidable straight wake yet the arbitrary vein in which at these
times he is said to swim generally embraces some few miles in width
more or less as the vein is presumed to expand or contract but
never exceeds the visual sweep from the whaleships mastheads
when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone the sum is that at
particular seasons within that breadth and along that path migrating
whales may with great confidence be looked for

and hence not only at substantiated times upon well known separate
feedinggrounds could ahab hope to encounter his prey but in crossing
the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could by his
art so place and time himself on his way as even then not to be wholly
without prospect of a meeting

there was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his
delirious but still methodical scheme but not so in the reality
perhaps though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons
for particular grounds yet in general you cannot conclude that the
herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year
say will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found
there the preceding season though there are peculiar and unquestionable
instances where the contrary of this has proved true in general the
same remark only within a less wide limit applies to the solitaries
and hermits among the matured aged sperm whales so that though moby
dick had in a former year been seen for example on what is called the
seychelle ground in the indian ocean or volcano bay on the japanese
coast yet it did not follow that were the pequod to visit either of
those spots at any subsequent corresponding season she would infallibly
encounter him there so too with some other feeding grounds where
he had at times revealed himself but all these seemed only his casual
stoppingplaces and oceaninns so to speak not his places of prolonged
abode and where ahabs chances of accomplishing his object have
hitherto been spoken of allusion has only been made to whatever
wayside antecedent extra prospects were his ere a particular
set time or place were attained when all possibilities would become
probabilities and as ahab fondly thought every possibility the next
thing to a certainty that particular set time and place were conjoined
in the one technical phrasethe seasonontheline for there and then
for several consecutive years moby dick had been periodically descried
lingering in those waters for awhile as the sun in its annual round
loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the zodiac there
it was too that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had
taken place there the waves were storied with his deeds there also was
that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive
to his vengeance but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering
vigilance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering
hunt he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one
crowning fact above mentioned however flattering it might be to those
hopes nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his
unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest

now the pequod had sailed from nantucket at the very beginning of the
seasonontheline no possible endeavor then could enable her commander
to make the great passage southwards double cape horn and then running
down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial pacific in time
to cruise there therefore he must wait for the next ensuing season
yet the premature hour of the pequods sailing had perhaps been
correctly selected by ahab with a view to this very complexion of
things because an interval of three hundred and sixtyfive days
and nights was before him an interval which instead of impatiently
enduring ashore he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt if by chance
the white whale spending his vacation in seas far remote from his
periodical feedinggrounds should turn up his wrinkled brow off the
persian gulf or in the bengal bay or china seas or in any other
waters haunted by his race so that monsoons pampas norwesters
harmattans trades any wind but the levanter and simoon might
blow moby dick into the devious zigzag worldcircle of the pequods
circumnavigating wake

but granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems it not
but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one solitary
whale even if encountered should be thought capable of individual
recognition from his hunter even as a whitebearded mufti in the
thronged thoroughfares of constantinople yes for the peculiar
snowwhite brow of moby dick and his snowwhite hump could not but
be unmistakable and have i not tallied the whale ahab would mutter
to himself as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he
would throw himself back in reveriestallied him and shall he escape
his broad fins are bored and scalloped out like a lost sheeps ear and
here his mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a weariness
and faintness of pondering came over him and in the open air of the
deck he would seek to recover his strength ah god what trances
of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved
revengeful desire he sleeps with clenched hands and wakes with his own
bloody nails in his palms

often when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid
dreams of the night which resuming his own intense thoughts through
the day carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies and whirled them
round and round and round in his blazing brain till the very throbbing
of his lifespot became insufferable anguish and when as was sometimes
the case these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its
base and a chasm seemed opening in him from which forked flames and
lightnings shot up and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among
them when this hell in himself yawned beneath him a wild cry would be
heard through the ship and with glaring eyes ahab would burst from his
state room as though escaping from a bed that was on fire yet these
perhaps instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent
weakness or fright at his own resolve were but the plainest tokens
of its intensity for at such times crazy ahab the scheming
unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this ahab that had
gone to his hammock was not the agent that so caused him to burst from
it in horror again the latter was the eternal living principle or
soul in him and in sleep being for the time dissociated from the
characterizing mind which at other times employed it for its outer
vehicle or agent it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching
contiguity of the frantic thing of which for the time it was no
longer an integral but as the mind does not exist unless leagued with
the soul therefore it must have been that in ahabs case yielding up
all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose that purpose
by its own sheer inveteracy of will forced itself against gods and
devils into a kind of selfassumed independent being of its own nay
could grimly live and burn while the common vitality to which it was
conjoined fled horrorstricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth
therefore the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes when
what seemed ahab rushed from his room was for the time but a vacated
thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray of living light to be
sure but without an object to colour and therefore a blankness in
itself god help thee old man thy thoughts have created a creature
in thee and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a prometheus a
vulture feeds upon that heart for ever that vulture the very creature
he creates



chapter 45 the affidavit


so far as what there may be of a narrative in this book and indeed as
indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars
in the habits of sperm whales the foregoing chapter in its earlier
part is as important a one as will be found in this volume but the
leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly
enlarged upon in order to be adequately understood and moreover to
take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire
subject may induce in some minds as to the natural verity of the main
points of this affair

i care not to perform this part of my task methodically but shall
be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of
items practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman and from these
citations i take itthe conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of
itself

first i have personally known three instances where a whale after
receiving a harpoon has effected a complete escape and after an
interval in one instance of three years has been again struck by
the same hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the same
private cypher have been taken from the body in the instance where
three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons and i
think it may have been something more than that the man who darted
them happening in the interval to go in a trading ship on a voyage to
africa went ashore there joined a discovery party and penetrated far
into the interior where he travelled for a period of nearly two years
often endangered by serpents savages tigers poisonous miasmas
with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of
unknown regions meanwhile the whale he had struck must also have
been on its travels no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe
brushing with its flanks all the coasts of africa but to no purpose
this man and this whale again came together and the one vanquished the
other i say i myself have known three instances similar to this that
is in two of them i saw the whales struck and upon the second attack
saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them afterwards
taken from the dead fish in the threeyear instance it so fell out
that i was in the boat both times first and last and the last time
distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whales
eye which i had observed there three years previous i say three years
but i am pretty sure it was more than that here are three instances
then which i personally know the truth of but i have heard of many
other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no
good ground to impeach

secondly it is well known in the sperm whale fishery however ignorant
the world ashore may be of it that there have been several memorable
historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at
distant times and places popularly cognisable why such a whale became
thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily
peculiarities as distinguished from other whales for however peculiar
in that respect any chance whale may be they soon put an end to his
peculiarities by killing him and boiling him down into a peculiarly
valuable oil no the reason was this that from the fatal experiences
of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about
such a whale as there did about rinaldo rinaldini insomuch that
most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their
tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea
without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance like some
poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man they
make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street lest if they
pursued the acquaintance further they might receive a summary thump for
their presumption

but not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual
celebritynay you may call it an oceanwide renown not only was he
famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death
but he was admitted into all the rights privileges and distinctions of
a name had as much a name indeed as cambyses or caesar was it not so
o timor tom thou famed leviathan scarred like an iceberg who so long
didst lurk in the oriental straits of that name whose spout was oft
seen from the palmy beach of ombay was it not so o new zealand jack
thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of
the tattoo land was it not so o morquan king of japan whose lofty
jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snowwhite cross
against the sky was it not so o don miguel thou chilian whale marked
like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back in plain
prose here are four whales as well known to the students of cetacean
history as marius or sylla to the classic scholar

but this is not all new zealand tom and don miguel after at various
times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels were
finally gone in quest of systematically hunted out chased and killed
by valiant whaling captains who heaved up their anchors with
that express object as much in view as in setting out through the
narragansett woods captain butler of old had it in his mind to capture
that notorious murderous savage annawon the headmost warrior of the
indian king philip

i do not know where i can find a better place than just here to make
mention of one or two other things which to me seem important as in
printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the
whole story of the white whale more especially the catastrophe for
this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full
as much bolstering as error so ignorant are most landsmen of some of
the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world that without
some hints touching the plain facts historical and otherwise of the
fishery they might scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable or still
worse and more detestable a hideous and intolerable allegory

first though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
perils of the grand fishery yet they have nothing like a fixed vivid
conception of those perils and the frequency with which they recur
one reason perhaps is that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and
deaths by casualties in the fishery ever finds a public record at home
however transient and immediately forgotten that record do you suppose
that that poor fellow there who this moment perhaps caught by the
whaleline off the coast of new guinea is being carried down to the
bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathando you suppose that that
poor fellows name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read
tomorrow at your breakfast no because the mails are very irregular
between here and new guinea in fact did you ever hear what might be
called regular news direct or indirect from new guinea yet i tell you
that upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacific among many
others we spoke thirty different ships every one of which had had a
death by a whale some of them more than one and three that had each
lost a boats crew for gods sake be economical with your lamps and
candles not a gallon you burn but at least one drop of mans blood was
spilled for it

secondly people ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is
an enormous creature of enormous power but i have ever found that when
narrating to them some specific example of this twofold enormousness
they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness when i
declare upon my soul i had no more idea of being facetious than moses
when he wrote the history of the plagues of egypt

but fortunately the special point i here seek can be established upon
testimony entirely independent of my own that point is this the sperm
whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful knowing and judiciously
malicious as with direct aforethought to stave in utterly destroy and
sink a large ship and what is more the sperm whale has done it

first in the year 1820 the ship essex captain pollard of nantucket
was cruising in the pacific ocean one day she saw spouts lowered her
boats and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales ere long several of
the whales were wounded when suddenly a very large whale escaping
from the boats issued from the shoal and bore directly down upon the
ship dashing his forehead against her hull he so stove her in that in
less than ten minutes she settled down and fell over not a surviving
plank of her has been seen since after the severest exposure part of
the crew reached the land in their boats being returned home at last
captain pollard once more sailed for the pacific in command of another
ship but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and
breakers for the second time his ship was utterly lost and forthwith
forswearing the sea he has never tempted it since at this day captain
pollard is a resident of nantucket i have seen owen chace who was
chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedy i have read his
plain and faithful narrative i have conversed with his son and all
this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe


the following are extracts from chaces narrative every fact seemed
to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which
directed his operations he made two several attacks upon the ship at
a short interval between them both of which according to their
direction were calculated to do us the most injury by being made
ahead and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock
to effect which the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary his
aspect was most horrible and such as indicated resentment and fury he
came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered and in
which we had struck three of his companions as if fired with revenge
for their sufferings again at all events the whole circumstances
taken together all happening before my own eyes and producing at the
time impressions in my mind of decided calculating mischief on the
part of the whale many of which impressions i cannot now recall
induce me to be satisfied that i am correct in my opinion

here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship during
a black night an open boat when almost despairing of reaching any
hospitable shore the dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing the
fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest or dashed
upon hidden rocks with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful
contemplation seemed scarcely entitled to a moments thought the
dismal looking wreck and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale
wholly engrossed my reflections until day again made its appearance

in another placep 45he speaks of the mysterious and mortal attack
of the animal


secondly the ship union also of nantucket was in the year 1807
totally lost off the azores by a similar onset but the authentic
particulars of this catastrophe i have never chanced to encounter
though from the whale hunters i have now and then heard casual allusions
to it

thirdly some eighteen or twenty years ago commodore j then
commanding an american sloopofwar of the first class happened to be
dining with a party of whaling captains on board a nantucket ship in
the harbor of oahu sandwich islands conversation turning upon whales
the commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength
ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present he peremptorily
denied for example that any whale could so smite his stout sloopofwar
as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful very good but there
is more coming some weeks after the commodore set sail in this
impregnable craft for valparaiso but he was stopped on the way by a
portly sperm whale that begged a few moments confidential business
with him that business consisted in fetching the commodores craft such
a thwack that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest
port to heave down and repair i am not superstitious but i consider
the commodores interview with that whale as providential was not saul
of tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright i tell you the
sperm whale will stand no nonsense

i will now refer you to langsdorffs voyages for a little circumstance
in point peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof langsdorff you
must know by the way was attached to the russian admiral krusensterns
famous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century
captain langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter

by the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail and the next day
we were out in the open sea on our way to ochotsh the weather was very
clear and fine but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on
our fur clothing for some days we had very little wind it was not
till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up an
uncommon large whale the body of which was larger than the ship itself
lay almost at the surface of the water but was not perceived by any
one on board till the moment when the ship which was in full sail
was almost upon him so that it was impossible to prevent its striking
against him we were thus placed in the most imminent danger as this
gigantic creature setting up its back raised the ship three feet at
least out of the water the masts reeled and the sails fell altogether
while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck concluding
that we had struck upon some rock instead of this we saw the monster
sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity captain dwolf
applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel
had received any damage from the shock but we found that very happily
it had escaped entirely uninjured

now the captain dwolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in
question is a new englander who after a long life of unusual
adventures as a seacaptain this day resides in the village of
dorchester near boston i have the honour of being a nephew of his i
have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in langsdorff
he substantiates every word the ship however was by no means a large
one a russian craft built on the siberian coast and purchased by my
uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home

in that up and down manly book of oldfashioned adventure so full too
of honest wondersthe voyage of lionel wafer one of ancient dampiers
old chumsi found a little matter set down so like that just quoted
from langsdorff that i cannot forbear inserting it here for a
corroborative example if such be needed

lionel it seems was on his way to john ferdinando as he calls
the modern juan fernandes in our way thither he says about four
oclock in the morning when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues
from the main of america our ship felt a terrible shock which put our
men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were
or what to think but every one began to prepare for death and indeed
the shock was so sudden and violent that we took it for granted the
ship had struck against a rock but when the amazement was a little
over we cast the lead and sounded but found no ground the
suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages and
several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks captain davis who
lay with his head on a gun was thrown out of his cabin lionel then
goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake and seems to substantiate
the imputation by stating that a great earthquake somewhere about
that time did actually do great mischief along the spanish land but
i should not much wonder if in the darkness of that early hour of the
morning the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically
bumping the hull from beneath

i might proceed with several more examples one way or another known to
me of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale in more
than one instance he has been known not only to chase the assailing
boats back to their ships but to pursue the ship itself and long
withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks the english ship
pusie hall can tell a story on that head and as for his strength
let me say that there have been examples where the lines attached to a
running sperm whale have in a calm been transferred to the ship and
secured there the whale towing her great hull through the water as a
horse walks off with a cart again it is very often observed that if
the sperm whale once struck is allowed time to rally he then acts
not so often with blind rage as with wilful deliberate designs of
destruction to his pursuers nor is it without conveying some eloquent
indication of his character that upon being attacked he will frequently
open his mouth and retain it in that dread expansion for several
consecutive minutes but i must be content with only one more and a
concluding illustration a remarkable and most significant one by which
you will not fail to see that not only is the most marvellous event in
this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day but that these
marvels like all marvels are mere repetitions of the ages so that for
the millionth time we say amen with solomonverily there is nothing new
under the sun

in the sixth christian century lived procopius a christian magistrate
of constantinople in the days when justinian was emperor and belisarius
general as many know he wrote the history of his own times a work
every way of uncommon value by the best authorities he has always been
considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian except in
some one or two particulars not at all affecting the matter presently
to be mentioned

now in this history of his procopius mentions that during the term
of his prefecture at constantinople a great seamonster was captured
in the neighboring propontis or sea of marmora after having destroyed
vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty
years a fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be
gainsaid nor is there any reason it should be of what precise species
this seamonster was is not mentioned but as he destroyed ships as
well as for other reasons he must have been a whale and i am strongly
inclined to think a sperm whale and i will tell you why for a long
time i fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the
mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it even now i am
certain that those seas are not and perhaps never can be in the
present constitution of things a place for his habitual gregarious
resort but further investigations have recently proved to me that in
modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the
sperm whale in the mediterranean i am told on good authority that
on the barbary coast a commodore davis of the british navy found
the skeleton of a sperm whale now as a vessel of war readily passes
through the dardanelles hence a sperm whale could by the same route
pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis

in the propontis as far as i can learn none of that peculiar substance
called brit is to be found the aliment of the right whale but i have
every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whalesquid or
cuttlefishlurks at the bottom of that sea because large creatures
but by no means the largest of that sort have been found at its
surface if then you properly put these statements together and
reason upon them a bit you will clearly perceive that according to all
human reasoning procopiuss seamonster that for half a century stove
the ships of a roman emperor must in all probability have been a sperm
whale



chapter 46 surmises


though consumed with the hot fire of his purpose ahab in all his
thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of moby dick
though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one
passion nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long
habituation far too wedded to a fiery whalemans ways altogether to
abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage or at least if
this were otherwise there were not wanting other motives much more
influential with him it would be refining too much perhaps even
considering his monomania to hint that his vindictiveness towards the
white whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all
sperm whales and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he
multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would
prove to be the hated one he hunted but if such an hypothesis be indeed
exceptionable there were still additional considerations which though
not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion yet
were by no means incapable of swaying him

to accomplish his object ahab must use tools and of all tools used in
the shadow of the moon men are most apt to get out of order he knew
for example that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was
over starbuck yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual
man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual
mastership for to the purely spiritual the intellectual but stand in a
sort of corporeal relation starbucks body and starbucks coerced will
were ahabs so long as ahab kept his magnet at starbucks brain still
he knew that for all this the chief mate in his soul abhorred his
captains quest and could he would joyfully disintegrate himself from
it or even frustrate it it might be that a long interval would elapse
ere the white whale was seen during that long interval starbuck
would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his
captains leadership unless some ordinary prudential circumstantial
influences were brought to bear upon him not only that but the subtle
insanity of ahab respecting moby dick was noways more significantly
manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing
that for the present the hunt should in some way be stripped of that
strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it that
the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure
background for few mens courage is proof against protracted meditation
unrelieved by action that when they stood their long night watches
his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than moby
dick for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the
announcement of his quest yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less
capricious and unreliablethey live in the varying outer weather and
they inhale its ficklenessand when retained for any object remote and
blank in the pursuit however promissory of life and passion in the
end it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and
employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the
final dash

nor was ahab unmindful of another thing in times of strong emotion
mankind disdain all base considerations but such times are evanescent
the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man thought
ahab is sordidness granting that the white whale fully incites the
hearts of this my savage crew and playing round their savageness even
breeds a certain generous knighterrantism in them still while for the
love of it they give chase to moby dick they must also have food
for their more common daily appetites for even the high lifted and
chivalric crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two
thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre without
committing burglaries picking pockets and gaining other pious
perquisites by the way had they been strictly held to their one final
and romantic objectthat final and romantic object too many would have
turned from in disgust i will not strip these men thought ahab of all
hopes of cashaye cash they may scorn cash now but let some months
go by and no perspective promise of it to them and then this same
quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash would soon
cashier ahab

nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related
to ahab personally having impulsively it is probable and perhaps
somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the
pequods voyage ahab was now entirely conscious that in so doing
he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of
usurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal his crew
if so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all further
obedience to him and even violently wrest from him the command from
even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation and the possible
consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground ahab must
of course have been most anxious to protect himself that protection
could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand
backed by a heedful closely calculating attention to every minute
atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected
to

for all these reasons then and others perhaps too analytic to be
verbally developed here ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good
degree continue true to the natural nominal purpose of the pequods
voyage observe all customary usages and not only that but force
himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general
pursuit of his profession

be all this as it may his voice was now often heard hailing the three
mastheads and admonishing them to keep a bright lookout and not omit
reporting even a porpoise this vigilance was not long without reward



chapter 47 the matmaker


it was a cloudy sultry afternoon the seamen were lazily lounging
about the decks or vacantly gazing over into the leadcoloured waters
queequeg and i were mildly employed weaving what is called a swordmat
for an additional lashing to our boat so still and subdued and yet
somehow preluding was all the scene and such an incantation of reverie
lurked in the air that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own
invisible self

i was the attendant or page of queequeg while busy at the mat as i
kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between
the long yarns of the warp using my own hand for the shuttle and as
queequeg standing sideways ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword
between the threads and idly looking off upon the water carelessly and
unthinkingly drove home every yarn i say so strange a dreaminess did
there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea only broken by
the intermitting dull sound of the sword that it seemed as if this were
the loom of time and i myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving
and weaving away at the fates there lay the fixed threads of the warp
subject to but one single ever returning unchanging vibration and
that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending
of other threads with its own this warp seemed necessity and here
thought i with my own hand i ply my own shuttle and weave my own
destiny into these unalterable threads meantime queequegs impulsive
indifferent sword sometimes hitting the woof slantingly or crookedly
or strongly or weakly as the case might be and by this difference
in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final
aspect of the completed fabric this savages sword thought i
which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof this
easy indifferent sword must be chanceaye chance free will and
necessitynowise incompatibleall interweavingly working together
the straight warp of necessity not to be swerved from its ultimate
courseits every alternating vibration indeed only tending to that
free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads and
chance though restrained in its play within the right lines of
necessity and sideways in its motions directed by free will though
thus prescribed to by both chance by turns rules either and has the
last featuring blow at events


thus we were weaving and weaving away when i started at a sound so
strange long drawn and musically wild and unearthly that the ball
of free will dropped from my hand and i stood gazing up at the clouds
whence that voice dropped like a wing high aloft in the crosstrees was
that mad gayheader tashtego his body was reaching eagerly forward
his hand stretched out like a wand and at brief sudden intervals he
continued his cries to be sure the same sound was that very moment
perhaps being heard all over the seas from hundreds of whalemens
lookouts perched as high in the air but from few of those lungs could
that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from
tashtego the indians

as he stood hovering over you half suspended in air so wildly and
eagerly peering towards the horizon you would have thought him some
prophet or seer beholding the shadows of fate and by those wild cries
announcing their coming

there she blows there there there she blows she blows

whereaway

on the leebeam about two miles off a school of them

instantly all was commotion

the sperm whale blows as a clock ticks with the same undeviating and
reliable uniformity and thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from
other tribes of his genus

there go flukes was now the cry from tashtego and the whales
disappeared

quick steward cried ahab time time

doughboy hurried below glanced at the watch and reported the exact
minute to ahab

the ship was now kept away from the wind and she went gently rolling
before it tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to
leeward we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of
our bows for that singular craft at times evinced by the sperm whale
when sounding with his head in one direction he nevertheless while
concealed beneath the surface mills round and swiftly swims off in the
opposite quarterthis deceitfulness of his could not now be in action
for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by tashtego had
been in any way alarmed or indeed knew at all of our vicinity one of
the men selected for shipkeepersthat is those not appointed to the
boats by this time relieved the indian at the mainmast head the
sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down the line tubs were fixed
in their places the cranes were thrust out the mainyard was backed
and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over
high cliffs outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand
clung to the rail while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale
so look the long line of manofwars men about to throw themselves on
board an enemys ship

but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took
every eye from the whale with a start all glared at dark ahab who was
surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air



chapter 48 the first lowering


the phantoms for so they then seemed were flitting on the other side
of the deck and with a noiseless celerity were casting loose the
tackles and bands of the boat which swung there this boat had always
been deemed one of the spare boats though technically called the
captains on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter the
figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart with one white
tooth evilly protruding from its steellike lips a rumpled chinese
jacket of black cotton funereally invested him with wide black trowsers
of the same dark stuff but strangely crowning this ebonness was a
glistening white plaited turban the living hair braided and coiled
round and round upon his head less swart in aspect the companions of
this figure were of that vivid tigeryellow complexion peculiar to
some of the aboriginal natives of the manillasa race notorious for
a certain diabolism of subtilty and by some honest white mariners
supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the
water of the devil their lord whose countingroom they suppose to be
elsewhere

while yet the wondering ships company were gazing upon these strangers
ahab cried out to the whiteturbaned old man at their head all ready
there fedallah

ready was the halfhissed reply

lower away then dye hear shouting across the deck lower away
there i say

such was the thunder of his voice that spite of their amazement the men
sprang over the rail the sheaves whirled round in the blocks with a
wallow the three boats dropped into the sea while with a dexterous
offhanded daring unknown in any other vocation the sailors
goatlike leaped down the rolling ships side into the tossed boats
below

hardly had they pulled out from under the ships lee when a fourth
keel coming from the windward side pulled round under the stern and
showed the five strangers rowing ahab who standing erect in the stern
loudly hailed starbuck stubb and flask to spread themselves widely
so as to cover a large expanse of water but with all their eyes again
riveted upon the swart fedallah and his crew the inmates of the other
boats obeyed not the command

captain ahab said starbuck

spread yourselves cried ahab give way all four boats thou flask
pull out more to leeward

aye aye sir cheerily cried little kingpost sweeping round
his great steering oar lay back addressing his crew
theretherethere again there she blows right ahead boyslay
back

never heed yonder yellow boys archy

oh i dont mindem sir said archy i knew it all before now
didnt i hear em in the hold and didnt i tell cabaco here of it what
say ye cabaco they are stowaways mr flask

pull pull my fine heartsalive pull my children pull my little
ones drawlingly and soothingly sighed stubb to his crew some of whom
still showed signs of uneasiness why dont you break your backbones
my boys what is it you stare at those chaps in yonder boat tut they
are only five more hands come to help usnever mind from wherethe
more the merrier pull then do pull never mind the brimstonedevils
are good fellows enough so so there you are now thats the stroke
for a thousand pounds thats the stroke to sweep the stakes hurrah
for the gold cup of sperm oil my heroes three cheers menall hearts
alive easy easy dont be in a hurrydont be in a hurry why dont
you snap your oars you rascals bite something you dogs so so so
thensoftly softly thats itthats it long and strong give way
there give way the devil fetch ye ye ragamuffin rapscallions ye are
all asleep stop snoring ye sleepers and pull pull will ye pull
cant ye pull wont ye why in the name of gudgeons and gingercakes
dont ye pullpull and break something pull and start your eyes out
here whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle every mothers son
of ye draw his knife and pull with the blade between his teeth thats
itthats it now ye do something that looks like it my steelbits
start herstart her my silverspoons start her marlingspikes

stubbs exordium to his crew is given here at large because he had
rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general and especially in
inculcating the religion of rowing but you must not suppose from this
specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions
with his congregation not at all and therein consisted his chief
peculiarity he would say the most terrific things to his crew in a
tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury and the fury seemed so
calculated merely as a spice to the fun that no oarsman could hear such
queer invocations without pulling for dear life and yet pulling for
the mere joke of the thing besides he all the time looked so easy and
indolent himself so loungingly managed his steeringoar and so broadly
gapedopenmouthed at timesthat the mere sight of such a yawning
commander by sheer force of contrast acted like a charm upon the crew
then again stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists whose jollity
is sometimes so curiously ambiguous as to put all inferiors on their
guard in the matter of obeying them

in obedience to a sign from ahab starbuck was now pulling obliquely
across stubbs bow and when for a minute or so the two boats were
pretty near to each other stubb hailed the mate

mr starbuck larboard boat there ahoy a word with ye sir if ye
please

halloa returned starbuck turning round not a single inch as he
spoke still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew his face set
like a flint from stubbs

what think ye of those yellow boys sir

smuggled on board somehow before the ship sailed strong strong
boys in a whisper to his crew then speaking out loud again a sad
business mr stubb seethe her seethe her my lads but never mind
mr stubb all for the best let all your crew pull strong come what
will spring my men spring theres hogsheads of sperm ahead mr
stubb and thats what ye came for pull my boys sperm sperms the
play this at least is duty duty and profit hand in hand

aye aye i thought as much soliloquized stubb when the boats
diverged as soon as i clapt eye on em i thought so aye and thats
what he went into the after hold for so often as doughboy long
suspected they were hidden down there the white whales at the bottom
of it well well so be it cant be helped all right give way men
it aint the white whale today give way

now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant
as the lowering of the boats from the deck this had not unreasonably
awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ships
company but archys fancied discovery having some time previous got
abroad among them though indeed not credited then this had in some
small measure prepared them for the event it took off the extreme edge
of their wonder and so what with all this and stubbs confident way
of accounting for their appearance they were for the time freed from
superstitious surmisings though the affair still left abundant room for
all manner of wild conjectures as to dark ahabs precise agency in the
matter from the beginning for me i silently recalled the mysterious
shadows i had seen creeping on board the pequod during the dim nantucket
dawn as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable elijah

meantime ahab out of hearing of his officers having sided the
furthest to windward was still ranging ahead of the other boats a
circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him those tiger
yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone like five
triphammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength which
periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst
boiler out of a mississippi steamer as for fedallah who was seen
pulling the harpooneer oar he had thrown aside his black jacket and
displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the
gunwale clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery
horizon while at the other end of the boat ahab with one arm like a
fencers thrown half backward into the air as if to counterbalance any
tendency to trip ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in
a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him all at once
the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed
while the boats five oars were seen simultaneously peaked boat and
crew sat motionless on the sea instantly the three spread boats in the
rear paused on their way the whales had irregularly settled bodily
down into the blue thus giving no distantly discernible token of the
movement though from his closer vicinity ahab had observed it

every man look out along his oars cried starbuck thou queequeg
stand up

nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow the savage
stood erect there and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the
spot where the chase had last been descried likewise upon the extreme
stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with
the gunwale starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing
himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft and silently
eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea

not very far distant flasks boat was also lying breathlessly still its
commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead a stout
sort of post rooted in the keel and rising some two feet above the
level of the stern platform it is used for catching turns with the
whale line its top is not more spacious than the palm of a mans hand
and standing upon such a base as that flask seemed perched at the
masthead of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks but little
kingpost was small and short and at the same time little kingpost was
full of a large and tall ambition so that this loggerhead standpoint
of his did by no means satisfy kingpost

i cant see three seas off tip us up an oar there and let me on to
that

upon this daggoo with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his
way swiftly slid aft and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty
shoulders for a pedestal

good a masthead as any sir will you mount

that i will and thank ye very much my fine fellow only i wish you
fifty feet taller

whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the
boat the gigantic negro stooping a little presented his flat palm to
flasks foot and then putting flasks hand on his hearseplumed head
and bidding him spring as he himself should toss with one dexterous
fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders and here was
flask now standing daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a
breastband to lean against and steady himself by

at any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous
habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect
posture in his boat even when pitched about by the most riotously
perverse and crossrunning seas still more strange to see him giddily
perched upon the loggerhead itself under such circumstances but the
sight of little flask mounted upon gigantic daggoo was yet more curious
for sustaining himself with a cool indifferent easy unthought of
barbaric majesty the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously
rolled his fine form on his broad back flaxenhaired flask seemed
a snowflake the bearer looked nobler than the rider though truly
vivacious tumultuous ostentatious little flask would now and then
stamp with impatience but not one added heave did he thereby give to
the negros lordly chest so have i seen passion and vanity stamping the
living magnanimous earth but the earth did not alter her tides and her
seasons for that

meanwhile stubb the third mate betrayed no such fargazing
solicitudes the whales might have made one of their regular soundings
not a temporary dive from mere fright and if that were the case
stubb as his wont in such cases it seems was resolved to solace the
languishing interval with his pipe he withdrew it from his hatband
where he always wore it aslant like a feather he loaded it and rammed
home the loading with his thumbend but hardly had he ignited his match
across the rough sandpaper of his hand when tashtego his harpooneer
whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars suddenly
dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat crying out in a
quick phrensy of hurry down down all and give waythere they are

to a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have been
visible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
water and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it and
suffusingly blowing off to leeward like the confused scud from white
rolling billows the air around suddenly vibrated and tingled as it
were like the air over intensely heated plates of iron beneath this
atmospheric waving and curling and partially beneath a thin layer of
water also the whales were swimming seen in advance of all the other
indications the puffs of vapour they spouted seemed their forerunning
couriers and detached flying outriders

all four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled
water and air but it bade fair to outstrip them it flew on and on
as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the
hills

pull pull my good boys said starbuck in the lowest possible but
intensest concentrated whisper to his men while the sharp fixed glance
from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow almost seemed as two
visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses he did not say much
to his crew though nor did his crew say anything to him only the
silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his
peculiar whispers now harsh with command now soft with entreaty

how different the loud little kingpost sing out and say something
my hearties roar and pull my thunderbolts beach me beach me on their
black backs boys only do that for me and ill sign over to you my
marthas vineyard plantation boys including wife and children boys
lay me onlay me on o lord lord but i shall go stark staring mad
see see that white water and so shouting he pulled his hat from his
head and stamped up and down on it then picking it up flirted it far
off upon the sea and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boats
stern like a crazed colt from the prairie

look at that chap now philosophically drawled stubb who with his
unlighted short pipe mechanically retained between his teeth at a
short distance followed afterhes got fits that flask has fits
yes give him fitsthats the very wordpitch fits into em merrily
merrily heartsalive pudding for supper you knowmerrys the word
pull babespull sucklingspull all but what the devil are you
hurrying about softly softly and steadily my men only pull and
keep pulling nothing more crack all your backbones and bite your
knives in twothats all take it easywhy dont ye take it easy i
say and burst all your livers and lungs

but what it was that inscrutable ahab said to that tigeryellow crew of
histhese were words best omitted here for you live under the blessed
light of the evangelical land only the infidel sharks in the audacious
seas may give ear to such words when with tornado brow and eyes of
red murder and foamglued lips ahab leaped after his prey

meanwhile all the boats tore on the repeated specific allusions of
flask to that whale as he called the fictitious monster which
he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boats bow with its
tailthese allusions of his were at times so vivid and lifelike that
they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look
over the shoulder but this was against all rule for the oarsmen
must put out their eyes and ram a skewer through their necks usage
pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears and no limbs but
arms in these critical moments

it was a sight full of quick wonder and awe the vast swells of the
omnipotent sea the surging hollow roar they made as they rolled along
the eight gunwales like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowlinggreen
the brief suspended agony of the boat as it would tip for an instant on
the knifelike edge of the sharper waves that almost seemed threatening
to cut it in two the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and
hollows the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite
hill the headlong sledlike slide down its other sideall these
with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers and the shuddering gasps
of the oarsmen with the wondrous sight of the ivory pequod bearing
down upon her boats with outstretched sails like a wild hen after her
screaming broodall this was thrilling

not the raw recruit marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever
heat of his first battle not the dead mans ghost encountering the
first unknown phantom in the other worldneither of these can feel
stranger and stronger emotions than that man does who for the first
time finds himself pulling into the charmed churned circle of the
hunted sperm whale

the dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more
visible owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloudshadows
flung upon the sea the jets of vapour no longer blended but tilted
everywhere to right and left the whales seemed separating their wakes
the boats were pulled more apart starbuck giving chase to three whales
running dead to leeward our sail was now set and with the still
rising wind we rushed along the boat going with such madness through
the water that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to
escape being torn from the rowlocks

soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist neither ship
nor boat to be seen

give way men whispered starbuck drawing still further aft the sheet
of his sail there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes
theres white water againclose to spring

soon after two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted
that the other boats had got fast but hardly were they overheard when
with a lightninglike hurtling whisper starbuck said stand up and
queequeg harpoon in hand sprang to his feet

though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril
so close to them ahead yet with their eyes on the intense countenance
of the mate in the stern of the boat they knew that the imminent
instant had come they heard too an enormous wallowing sound as of
fifty elephants stirring in their litter meanwhile the boat was still
booming through the mist the waves curling and hissing around us like
the erected crests of enraged serpents

thats his hump there there give it to him whispered starbuck

a short rushing sound leaped out of the boat it was the darted iron of
queequeg then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from
astern while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge the sail
collapsed and exploded a gush of scalding vapour shot up near by
something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us the whole
crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helterskelter into the
white curdling cream of the squall squall whale and harpoon had all
blended together and the whale merely grazed by the iron escaped

though completely swamped the boat was nearly unharmed swimming round
it we picked up the floating oars and lashing them across the gunwale
tumbled back to our places there we sat up to our knees in the sea the
water covering every rib and plank so that to our downward gazing eyes
the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom
of the ocean

the wind increased to a howl the waves dashed their bucklers together
the whole squall roared forked and crackled around us like a white
fire upon the prairie in which unconsumed we were burning immortal
in these jaws of death in vain we hailed the other boats as well roar
to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those
boats in that storm meanwhile the driving scud rack and mist grew
darker with the shadows of night no sign of the ship could be seen
the rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat the oars were
useless as propellers performing now the office of lifepreservers
so cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg after many failures
starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern then stretching
it on a waif pole handed it to queequeg as the standardbearer of this
forlorn hope there then he sat holding up that imbecile candle in
the heart of that almighty forlornness there then he sat the sign
and symbol of a man without faith hopelessly holding up hope in the
midst of despair

wet drenched through and shivering cold despairing of ship or boat
we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on the mist still spread over
the sea the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat
suddenly queequeg started to his feet hollowing his hand to his ear
we all heard a faint creaking as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by
the storm the sound came nearer and nearer the thick mists were dimly
parted by a huge vague form affrighted we all sprang into the sea as
the ship at last loomed into view bearing right down upon us within a
distance of not much more than its length

floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat as for one instant it
tossed and gaped beneath the ships bows like a chip at the base of a
cataract and then the vast hull rolled over it and it was seen no
more till it came up weltering astern again we swam for it were dashed
against it by the seas and were at last taken up and safely landed on
board ere the squall came close to the other boats had cut loose from
their fish and returned to the ship in good time the ship had given us
up but was still cruising if haply it might light upon some token of
our perishingan oar or a lance pole



chapter 49 the hyena


there are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair
we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical
joke though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns and more than
suspects that the joke is at nobodys expense but his own however
nothing dispirits and nothing seems worth while disputing he bolts
down all events all creeds and beliefs and persuasions all hard
things visible and invisible never mind how knobby as an ostrich of
potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints and as for small
difficulties and worryings prospects of sudden disaster peril of
life and limb all these and death itself seem to him only sly
goodnatured hits and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen
and unaccountable old joker that odd sort of wayward mood i am speaking
of comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation it comes
in the very midst of his earnestness so that what just before might
have seemed to him a thing most momentous now seems but a part of the
general joke there is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this
free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy and with it i now
regarded this whole voyage of the pequod and the great white whale its
object

queequeg said i when they had dragged me the last man to the deck
and i was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water
queequeg my fine friend does this sort of thing often happen
without much emotion though soaked through just like me he gave me to
understand that such things did often happen

mr stubb said i turning to that worthy who buttoned up in his
oiljacket was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain mr stubb i
think i have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met our chief
mate mr starbuck is by far the most careful and prudent i suppose
then that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy
squall is the height of a whalemans discretion

certain ive lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off cape
horn

mr flask said i turning to little kingpost who was standing close
by you are experienced in these things and i am not will you tell
me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery mr flask for an
oarsman to break his own back pulling himself backforemost into deaths
jaws

cant you twist that smaller said flask yes thats the law
i should like to see a boats crew backing water up to a whale face
foremost ha ha the whale would give them squint for squint mind
that

here then from three impartial witnesses i had a deliberate statement
of the entire case considering therefore that squalls and capsizings
in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep were matters
of common occurrence in this kind of life considering that at the
superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale i must resign my
life into the hands of him who steered the boatoftentimes a fellow who
at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling
the craft with his own frantic stampings considering that the
particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed
to starbucks driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall
and considering that starbuck notwithstanding was famous for his
great heedfulness in the fishery considering that i belonged to this
uncommonly prudent starbucks boat and finally considering in what a
devils chase i was implicated touching the white whale taking all
things together i say i thought i might as well go below and make a
rough draft of my will queequeg said i come along you shall be my
lawyer executor and legatee

it may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their
last wills and testaments but there are no people in the world more
fond of that diversion this was the fourth time in my nautical life
that i had done the same thing after the ceremony was concluded upon
the present occasion i felt all the easier a stone was rolled away
from my heart besides all the days i should now live would be as good
as the days that lazarus lived after his resurrection a supplementary
clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be i survived
myself my death and burial were locked up in my chest i looked
round me tranquilly and contentedly like a quiet ghost with a clean
conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault

now then thought i unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock
here goes for a cool collected dive at death and destruction and the
devil fetch the hindmost



chapter 50 ahabs boat and crew fedallah


who would have thought it flask cried stubb if i had but one leg
you would not catch me in a boat unless maybe to stop the plughole
with my timber toe oh hes a wonderful old man

i dont think it so strange after all on that account said flask
if his leg were off at the hip now it would be a different thing
that would disable him but he has one knee and good part of the other
left you know

i dont know that my little man i never yet saw him kneel


among whalewise people it has often been argued whether considering
the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage it is
right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils
of the chase so tamerlanes soldiers often argued with tears in their
eyes whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the
thickest of the fight

but with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect considering
that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger
considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and
extraordinary difficulties that every individual moment indeed then
comprises a peril under these circumstances is it wise for any
maimed man to enter a whaleboat in the hunt as a general thing the
jointowners of the pequod must have plainly thought not

ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of
his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of
the chase for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving
his orders in person yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually
apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the huntabove all for
captain ahab to be supplied with five extra men as that same boats
crew he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads
of the owners of the pequod therefore he had not solicited a boats
crew from them nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head
nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all
that matter until cabacos published discovery the sailors had little
foreseen it though to be sure when after being a little while out
of port all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the
whaleboats for service when some time after this ahab was now and then
found bestirring himself in the matter of making tholepins with his
own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats and even
solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers which when the line is
running out are pinned over the groove in the bow when all this was
observed in him and particularly his solicitude in having an extra
coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat as if to make it better
withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb and also the anxiety
he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board or clumsy cleat as it is
sometimes called the horizontal piece in the boats bow for bracing the
knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale when it was observed
how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the
semicircular depression in the cleat and with the carpenters chisel
gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there all these
things i say had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time but
almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness
in ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of moby dick
for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster
in person but such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest
suspicion as to any boats crew being assigned to that boat

now with the subordinate phantoms what wonder remained soon waned
away for in a whaler wonders soon wane besides now and then such
unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown
nooks and ashholes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of
whalers and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway
creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks bits of wreck
oars whaleboats canoes blownoff japanese junks and what not that
beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin
to chat with the captain and it would not create any unsubduable
excitement in the forecastle

but be all this as it may certain it is that while the subordinate
phantoms soon found their place among the crew though still as it were
somehow distinct from them yet that hairturbaned fedallah remained
a muffled mystery to the last whence he came in a mannerly world like
this by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be
linked with ahabs peculiar fortunes nay so far as to have some sort
of a halfhinted influence heaven knows but it might have been even
authority over him all this none knew but one cannot sustain
an indifferent air concerning fedallah he was such a creature as
civilized domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their
dreams and that but dimly but the like of whom now and then glide
among the unchanging asiatic communities especially the oriental isles
to the east of the continentthose insulated immemorial unalterable
countries which even in these modern days still preserve much of the
ghostly aboriginalness of earths primal generations when the memory of
the first man was a distinct recollection and all men his descendants
unknowing whence he came eyed each other as real phantoms and asked of
the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end when though
according to genesis the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of
men the devils also add the uncanonical rabbins indulged in mundane
amours



chapter 51 the spiritspout


days weeks passed and under easy sail the ivory pequod had slowly
swept across four several cruisinggrounds that off the azores off the
cape de verdes on the plate so called being off the mouth of the
rio de la plata and the carrol ground an unstaked watery locality
southerly from st helena

it was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and
moonlight night when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver
and by their soft suffusing seethings made what seemed a silvery
silence not a solitude on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen
far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow lit up by the moon it
looked celestial seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from
the sea fedallah first descried this jet for of these moonlight
nights it was his wont to mount to the mainmast head and stand a
lookout there with the same precision as if it had been day and yet
though herds of whales were seen by night not one whaleman in a hundred
would venture a lowering for them you may think with what emotions
then the seamen beheld this old oriental perched aloft at such unusual
hours his turban and the moon companions in one sky but when after
spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights
without uttering a single sound when after all this silence his
unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery moonlit jet every
reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had
lighted in the rigging and hailed the mortal crew there she blows
had the trump of judgment blown they could not have quivered more yet
still they felt no terror rather pleasure for though it was a most
unwonted hour yet so impressive was the cry and so deliriously
exciting that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a
lowering

walking the deck with quick sidelunging strides ahab commanded the
tgallant sails and royals to be set and every stunsail spread the
best man in the ship must take the helm then with every masthead
manned the piledup craft rolled down before the wind the strange
upheaving lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows
of so many sails made the buoyant hovering deck to feel like air
beneath the feet while still she rushed along as if two antagonistic
influences were struggling in herone to mount direct to heaven the
other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal and had you watched
ahabs face that night you would have thought that in him also two
different things were warring while his one live leg made lively echoes
along the deck every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffintap
on life and death this old man walked but though the ship so swiftly
sped and though from every eye like arrows the eager glances shot
yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night every sailor swore he
saw it once but not a second time

this midnightspout had almost grown a forgotten thing when some days
after lo at the same silent hour it was again announced again it
was descried by all but upon making sail to overtake it once more it
disappeared as if it had never been and so it served us night after
night till no one heeded it but to wonder at it mysteriously
jetted into the clear moonlight or starlight as the case might be
disappearing again for one whole day or two days or three and somehow
seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and
further in our van this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on

nor with the immemorial superstition of their race and in accordance
with the preternaturalness as it seemed which in many things invested
the pequod were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that
whenever and wherever descried at however remote times or in however
far apart latitudes and longitudes that unnearable spout was cast
by one selfsame whale and that whale moby dick for a time there
reigned too a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition
as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on in order that the
monster might turn round upon us and rend us at last in the remotest
and most savage seas

these temporary apprehensions so vague but so awful derived a wondrous
potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather in which beneath
all its blue blandness some thought there lurked a devilish charm as
for days and days we voyaged along through seas so wearily lonesomely
mild that all space in repugnance to our vengeful errand seemed
vacating itself of life before our urnlike prow

but at last when turning to the eastward the cape winds began howling
around us and we rose and fell upon the long troubled seas that are
there when the ivorytusked pequod sharply bowed to the blast and
gored the dark waves in her madness till like showers of silver chips
the foamflakes flew over her bulwarks then all this desolate vacuity
of life went away but gave place to sights more dismal than before

close to our bows strange forms in the water darted hither and thither
before us while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable searavens and
every morning perched on our stays rows of these birds were seen and
spite of our hootings for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp
as though they deemed our ship some drifting uninhabited craft a thing
appointed to desolation and therefore fit roostingplace for their
homeless selves and heaved and heaved still unrestingly heaved the
black sea as if its vast tides were a conscience and the great mundane
soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had
bred

cape of good hope do they call ye rather cape tormentoto as called
of yore for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had
attended us we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea
where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish seemed
condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store or beat
that black air without any horizon but calm snowwhite and unvarying
still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky still beckoning us
on from before the solitary jet would at times be descried

during all this blackness of the elements ahab though assuming for the
time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck
manifested the gloomiest reserve and more seldom than ever addressed
his mates in tempestuous times like these after everything above and
aloft has been secured nothing more can be done but passively to await
the issue of the gale then captain and crew become practical fatalists
so with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole and with one
hand firmly grasping a shroud ahab for hours and hours would stand
gazing dead to windward while an occasional squall of sleet or snow
would all but congeal his very eyelashes together meantime the crew
driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that
burstingly broke over its bows stood in a line along the bulwarks in
the waist and the better to guard against the leaping waves each man
had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail in which
he swung as in a loosened belt few or no words were spoken and the
silent ship as if manned by painted sailors in wax day after day tore
on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves
by night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the
ocean prevailed still in silence the men swung in the bowlines still
wordless ahab stood up to the blast even when wearied nature seemed
demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock never
could starbuck forget the old mans aspect when one night going down
into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood he saw him with
closed eyes sitting straight in his floorscrewed chair the rain
and halfmelted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before
emerged still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat on the
table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents
which have previously been spoken of his lantern swung from his tightly
clenched hand though the body was erect the head was thrown back so
that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the telltale
that swung from a beam in the ceiling


the cabincompass is called the telltale because without going to the
compass at the helm the captain while below can inform himself of the
course of the ship


terrible old man thought starbuck with a shudder sleeping in this
gale still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose



chapter 52 the albatross


southeastward from the cape off the distant crozetts a good cruising
ground for right whalemen a sail loomed ahead the goney albatross
by name as she slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch at the
foremasthead i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro
in the far ocean fisheriesa whaler at sea and long absent from home

as if the waves had been fullers this craft was bleached like the
skeleton of a stranded walrus all down her sides this spectral
appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust while all her
spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over
with hoarfrost only her lower sails were set a wild sight it was to
see her longbearded lookouts at those three mastheads they seemed
clad in the skins of beasts so torn and bepatched the raiment that had
survived nearly four years of cruising standing in iron hoops nailed to
the mast they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea and though when
the ship slowly glided close under our stern we six men in the air
came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the
mastheads of one ship to those of the other yet those forlornlooking
fishermen mildly eyeing us as they passed said not one word to our own
lookouts while the quarterdeck hail was being heard from below

ship ahoy have ye seen the white whale

but as the strange captain leaning over the pallid bulwarks was in the
act of putting his trumpet to his mouth it somehow fell from his hand
into the sea and the wind now rising amain he in vain strove to make
himself heard without it meantime his ship was still increasing the
distance between while in various silent ways the seamen of the pequod
were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first
mere mention of the white whales name to another ship ahab for a
moment paused it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat
to board the stranger had not the threatening wind forbade but taking
advantage of his windward position he again seized his trumpet and
knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a nantucketer and
shortly bound home he loudly hailedahoy there this is the pequod
bound round the world tell them to address all future letters to the
pacific ocean and this time three years if i am not at home tell them
to address them to

at that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed and instantly then
in accordance with their singular ways shoals of small harmless fish
that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side darted
away with what seemed shuddering fins and ranged themselves fore and
aft with the strangers flanks though in the course of his continual
voyagings ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight yet to
any monomaniac man the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings

swim away from me do ye murmured ahab gazing over into the water
there seemed but little in the words but the tone conveyed more of deep
helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced but
turning to the steersman who thus far had been holding the ship in the
wind to diminish her headway he cried out in his old lion voiceup
helm keep her off round the world

round the world there is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings
but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct only through
numberless perils to the very point whence we started where those that
we left behind secure were all the time before us

were this world an endless plain and by sailing eastward we could for
ever reach new distances and discover sights more sweet and strange
than any cyclades or islands of king solomon then there were promise
in the voyage but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of or in
tormented chase of that demon phantom that some time or other swims
before all human hearts while chasing such over this round globe they
either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed



chapter 53 the gam


the ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had
spoken was this the wind and sea betokened storms but even had
this not been the case he would not after all perhaps have boarded
herjudging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasionsif so it
had been that by the process of hailing he had obtained a negative
answer to the question he put for as it eventually turned out he
cared not to consort even for five minutes with any stranger captain
except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly
sought but all this might remain inadequately estimated were not
something said here of the peculiar usages of whalingvessels when
meeting each other in foreign seas and especially on a common
cruisingground

if two strangers crossing the pine barrens in new york state or the
equally desolate salisbury plain in england if casually encountering
each other in such inhospitable wilds these twain for the life of
them cannot well avoid a mutual salutation and stopping for a moment
to interchange the news and perhaps sitting down for a while
and resting in concert then how much more natural that upon the
illimitable pine barrens and salisbury plains of the sea two whaling
vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earthoff lone
fannings island or the far away kings mills how much more natural
i say that under such circumstances these ships should not only
interchange hails but come into still closer more friendly and
sociable contact and especially would this seem to be a matter of
course in the case of vessels owned in one seaport and whose captains
officers and not a few of the men are personally known to each other
and consequently have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about

for the long absent ship the outwardbounder perhaps has letters on
board at any rate she will be sure to let her have some papers of a
date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumbworn
files and in return for that courtesy the outwardbound ship would
receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruisingground to
which she may be destined a thing of the utmost importance to her and
in degree all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing
each others track on the cruisingground itself even though they
are equally long absent from home for one of them may have received a
transfer of letters from some third and now far remote vessel and
some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets
besides they would exchange the whaling news and have an agreeable
chat for not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors
but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common
pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils

nor would difference of country make any very essential difference
that is so long as both parties speak one language as is the case
with americans and english though to be sure from the small number of
english whalers such meetings do not very often occur and when they
do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them for your
englishman is rather reserved and your yankee he does not fancy that
sort of thing in anybody but himself besides the english whalers
sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the american
whalers regarding the long lean nantucketer with his nondescript
provincialisms as a sort of seapeasant but where this superiority
in the english whalemen does really consist it would be hard to say
seeing that the yankees in one day collectively kill more whales than
all the english collectively in ten years but this is a harmless
little foible in the english whalehunters which the nantucketer does
not take much to heart probably because he knows that he has a few
foibles himself

so then we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea the
whalers have most reason to be sociableand they are so whereas some
merchant ships crossing each others wake in the midatlantic will
oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition
mutually cutting each other on the high seas like a brace of dandies in
broadway and all the time indulging perhaps in finical criticism upon
each others rig as for menofwar when they chance to meet at sea
they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings such
a ducking of ensigns that there does not seem to be much rightdown
hearty goodwill and brotherly love about it at all as touching
slaveships meeting why they are in such a prodigious hurry they run
away from each other as soon as possible and as for pirates when they
chance to cross each others crossbones the first hail ishow many
skullsthe same way that whalers hailhow many barrels and that
question once answered pirates straightway steer apart for they are
infernal villains on both sides and dont like to see overmuch of each
others villanous likenesses

but look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociable
freeandeasy whaler what does the whaler do when she meets another
whaler in any sort of decent weather she has a gam a thing so
utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name
even and if by chance they should hear of it they only grin at it and
repeat gamesome stuff about spouters and blubberboilers and such
like pretty exclamations why it is that all merchantseamen and also
all pirates and manofwars men and slaveship sailors cherish such
a scornful feeling towards whaleships this is a question it would be
hard to answer because in the case of pirates say i should like to
know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about
it it sometimes ends in uncommon elevation indeed but only at the
gallows and besides when a man is elevated in that odd fashion he has
no proper foundation for his superior altitude hence i conclude
that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman in that
assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on

but what is a gam you might wear out your indexfinger running up and
down the columns of dictionaries and never find the word dr johnson
never attained to that erudition noah websters ark does not hold it
nevertheless this same expressive word has now for many years been in
constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankees certainly
it needs a definition and should be incorporated into the lexicon with
that view let me learnedly define it

gam nouna social meeting of two or more whaleships generally on a
cruisingground when after exchanging hails they exchange visits by
boats crews the two captains remaining for the time on board of one
ship and the two chief mates on the other

there is another little item about gamming which must not be forgotten
here all professions have their own little peculiarities of detail so
has the whale fishery in a pirate manofwar or slave ship when
the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat he always sits in the stern
sheets on a comfortable sometimes cushioned seat there and often
steers himself with a pretty little milliners tiller decorated with
gay cords and ribbons but the whaleboat has no seat astern no sofa of
that sort whatever and no tiller at all high times indeed if whaling
captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen
in patent chairs and as for a tiller the whaleboat never admits of
any such effeminacy and therefore as in gamming a complete boats crew
must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of
the number that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion and
the captain having no place to sit in is pulled off to his visit
all standing like a pine tree and often you will notice that being
conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from
the sides of the two ships this standing captain is all alive to the
importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs nor is
this any very easy matter for in his rear is the immense projecting
steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back the
afteroar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front he is thus
completely wedged before and behind and can only expand himself
sideways by settling down on his stretched legs but a sudden violent
pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him because length of
foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth merely make a
spread angle of two poles and you cannot stand them up then again
it would never do in plain sight of the worlds riveted eyes it would
never do i say for this straddling captain to be seen steadying
himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with
his hands indeed as token of his entire buoyant selfcommand he
generally carries his hands in his trowsers pockets but perhaps being
generally very large heavy hands he carries them there for ballast
nevertheless there have occurred instances well authenticated ones too
where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or
two in a sudden squall sayto seize hold of the nearest oarsmans
hair and hold on there like grim death



chapter 54 the townhos story


as told at the golden inn


the cape of good hope and all the watery region round about there is
much like some noted four corners of a great highway where you meet
more travellers than in any other part

it was not very long after speaking the goney that another
homewardbound whaleman the townho was encountered she was manned
almost wholly by polynesians in the short gam that ensued she gave
us strong news of moby dick to some the general interest in the white
whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the townhos
story which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain
wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of god
which at times are said to overtake some men this latter circumstance
with its own particular accompaniments forming what may be called the
secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated never reached the ears
of captain ahab or his mates for that secret part of the story was
unknown to the captain of the townho himself it was the private
property of three confederate white seamen of that ship one of whom it
seems communicated it to tashtego with romish injunctions of secrecy
but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep and revealed
so much of it in that way that when he was wakened he could not well
withhold the rest nevertheless so potent an influence did this thing
have on those seamen in the pequod who came to the full knowledge of
it and by such a strange delicacy to call it so were they governed in
this matter that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never
transpired abaft the pequods mainmast interweaving in its proper
place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the
ship the whole of this strange affair i now proceed to put on lasting
record


the ancient whalecry upon first sighting a whale from the masthead
still used by whalemen in hunting the famous gallipagos terrapin


for my humors sake i shall preserve the style in which i once narrated
it at lima to a lounging circle of my spanish friends one saints eve
smoking upon the thickgilt tiled piazza of the golden inn of those
fine cavaliers the young dons pedro and sebastian were on the closer
terms with me and hence the interluding questions they occasionally
put and which are duly answered at the time

some two years prior to my first learning the events which i am about
rehearsing to you gentlemen the townho sperm whaler of nantucket
was cruising in your pacific here not very many days sail eastward
from the eaves of this good golden inn she was somewhere to the
northward of the line one morning upon handling the pumps according to
daily usage it was observed that she made more water in her hold than
common they supposed a swordfish had stabbed her gentlemen but the
captain having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck
awaited him in those latitudes and therefore being very averse to quit
them and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous though
indeed they could not find it after searching the hold as low down
as was possible in rather heavy weather the ship still continued her
cruisings the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals
but no good luck came more days went by and not only was the leak yet
undiscovered but it sensibly increased so much so that now taking
some alarm the captain making all sail stood away for the nearest
harbor among the islands there to have his hull hove out and repaired

though no small passage was before her yet if the commonest chance
favoured he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way
because his pumps were of the best and being periodically relieved at
them those sixandthirty men of his could easily keep the ship free
never mind if the leak should double on her in truth well nigh the
whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes the
townho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port
without the occurrence of the least fatality had it not been for the
brutal overbearing of radney the mate a vineyarder and the bitterly
provoked vengeance of steelkilt a lakeman and desperado from buffalo

lakemanbuffalo pray what is a lakeman and where is buffalo
said don sebastian rising in his swinging mat of grass

on the eastern shore of our lake erie don buti crave your
courtesymay be you shall soon hear further of all that now
gentlemen in squaresail brigs and threemasted ships wellnigh as
large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old callao to far
manilla this lakeman in the landlocked heart of our america had yet
been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly
connected with the open ocean for in their interflowing aggregate
those grand freshwater seas of ourserie and ontario and huron and
superior and michiganpossess an oceanlike expansiveness with many
of the oceans noblest traits with many of its rimmed varieties of
races and of climes they contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles
even as the polynesian waters do in large part are shored by two great
contrasting nations as the atlantic is they furnish long maritime
approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east dotted
all round their banks here and there are frowned upon by batteries
and by the goatlike craggy guns of lofty mackinaw they have heard the
fleet thunderings of naval victories at intervals they yield their
beaches to wild barbarians whose red painted faces flash from out
their peltry wigwams for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient
and unentered forests where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines
of kings in gothic genealogies those same woods harboring wild afric
beasts of prey and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes
to tartar emperors they mirror the paved capitals of buffalo and
cleveland as well as winnebago villages they float alike the
fullrigged merchant ship the armed cruiser of the state the steamer
and the beech canoe they are swept by borean and dismasting blasts as
direful as any that lash the salted wave they know what shipwrecks are
for out of sight of land however inland they have drowned full many
a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew thus gentlemen though
an inlander steelkilt was wildocean born and wildocean nurtured
as much of an audacious mariner as any and for radney though in his
infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucket beach to nurse
at his maternal sea though in after life he had long followed our
austere atlantic and your contemplative pacific yet was he quite as
vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman fresh
from the latitudes of buckhorn handled bowieknives yet was this
nantucketer a man with some goodhearted traits and this lakeman a
mariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet by inflexible
firmness only tempered by that common decency of human recognition
which is the meanest slaves right thus treated this steelkilt had
long been retained harmless and docile at all events he had proved
so thus far but radney was doomed and made mad and steelkiltbut
gentlemen you shall hear

it was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing
her prow for her island haven that the townhos leak seemed again
increasing but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps
every day you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our
atlantic for example some skippers think little of pumping their whole
way across it though of a still sleepy night should the officer of
the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect the probability
would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it on
account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom nor in the
solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward gentlemen is it
altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pumphandles in
full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length that is if it lie
along a tolerably accessible coast or if any other reasonable retreat
is afforded them it is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of
the way part of those waters some really landless latitude that her
captain begins to feel a little anxious

much this way had it been with the townho so when her leak was found
gaining once more there was in truth some small concern manifested by
several of her company especially by radney the mate he commanded
the upper sails to be well hoisted sheeted home anew and every way
expanded to the breeze now this radney i suppose was as little of a
coward and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness
touching his own person as any fearless unthinking creature on land or
on sea that you can conveniently imagine gentlemen therefore when
he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship some of the
seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in
her so when they were working that evening at the pumps there was on
this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them as they stood
with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water
clear as any mountain spring gentlementhat bubbling from the pumps
ran across the deck and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee
scupperholes

now as you well know it is not seldom the case in this conventional
world of ourswatery or otherwise that when a person placed in command
over his fellowmen finds one of them to be very significantly his
superior in general pride of manhood straightway against that man he
conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness and if he have a
chance he will pull down and pulverize that subalterns tower and
make a little heap of dust of it be this conceit of mine as it may
gentlemen at all events steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a
head like a roman and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings
of your last viceroys snorting charger and a brain and a heart and
a soul in him gentlemen which had made steelkilt charlemagne had he
been born son to charlemagnes father but radney the mate was ugly
as a mule yet as hardy as stubborn as malicious he did not love
steelkilt and steelkilt knew it

espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the
rest the lakeman affected not to notice him but unawed went on with
his gay banterings

aye aye my merry lads its a lively leak this hold a cannikin one
of ye and lets have a taste by the lord its worth bottling i tell
ye what men old rads investment must go for it he had best cut away
his part of the hull and tow it home the fact is boys that swordfish
only began the job hes come back again with a gang of shipcarpenters
sawfish and filefish and what not and the whole posse of em
are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom making
improvements i suppose if old rad were here now id tell him to jump
overboard and scatter em theyre playing the devil with his estate i
can tell him but hes a simple old soulrad and a beauty too boys
they say the rest of his property is invested in lookingglasses i
wonder if hed give a poor devil like me the model of his nose

damn your eyes whats that pump stopping for roared radney
pretending not to have heard the sailors talk thunder away at it

aye aye sir said steelkilt merry as a cricket lively boys
lively now and with that the pump clanged like fifty fireengines
the men tossed their hats off to it and ere long that peculiar gasping
of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of lifes
utmost energies

quitting the pump at last with the rest of his band the lakeman went
forward all panting and sat himself down on the windlass his face
fiery red his eyes bloodshot and wiping the profuse sweat from his
brow now what cozening fiend it was gentlemen that possessed radney
to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state i know
not but so it happened intolerably striding along the deck the mate
commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks and also a
shovel and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig
to run at large

now gentlemen sweeping a ships deck at sea is a piece of household
work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every
evening it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually
foundering at the time such gentlemen is the inflexibility of
seausages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen some of whom
would not willingly drown without first washing their faces but in all
vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys
if boys there be aboard besides it was the stronger men in the townho
that had been divided into gangs taking turns at the pumps and being
the most athletic seaman of them all steelkilt had been regularly
assigned captain of one of the gangs consequently he should have
been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical
duties such being the case with his comrades i mention all these
particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood
between the two men

but there was more than this the order about the shovel was almost as
plainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt as though radney had spat
in his face any man who has gone sailor in a whaleship will
understand this and all this and doubtless much more the lakeman fully
comprehended when the mate uttered his command but as he sat still for
a moment and as he steadfastly looked into the mates malignant eye and
perceived the stacks of powdercasks heaped up in him and the slowmatch
silently burning along towards them as he instinctively saw all
this that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper
passionateness in any already ireful beinga repugnance most felt when
felt at all by really valiant men even when aggrievedthis nameless
phantom feeling gentlemen stole over steelkilt

therefore in his ordinary tone only a little broken by the bodily
exhaustion he was temporarily in he answered him saying that sweeping
the deck was not his business and he would not do it and then without
at all alluding to the shovel he pointed to three lads as the customary
sweepers who not being billeted at the pumps had done little or
nothing all day to this radney replied with an oath in a most
domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his
command meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman with an
uplifted coopers club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by

heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps for
all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkilt
could but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehow still
smothering the conflagration within him without speaking he remained
doggedly rooted to his seat till at last the incensed radney shook the
hammer within a few inches of his face furiously commanding him to do
his bidding

steelkilt rose and slowly retreating round the windlass steadily
followed by the mate with his menacing hammer deliberately repeated his
intention not to obey seeing however that his forbearance had not
the slightest effect by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his
twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man but it was to
no purpose and in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass
when resolved at last no longer to retreat bethinking him that he had
now forborne as much as comported with his humor the lakeman paused on
the hatches and thus spoke to the officer

mr radney i will not obey you take that hammer away or look to
yourself but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him where
the lakeman stood fixed now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of
his teeth meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions
retreating not the thousandth part of an inch stabbing him in the eye
with the unflinching poniard of his glance steelkilt clenching
his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back told his
persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he steelkilt would
murder him but gentlemen the fool had been branded for the slaughter
by the gods immediately the hammer touched the cheek the next instant
the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head he fell on the hatch
spouting blood like a whale

ere the cry could go aft steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays
leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their
mastheads they were both canallers

canallers cried don pedro we have seen many whaleships in our
harbours but never heard of your canallers pardon who and what are
they

canallers don are the boatmen belonging to our grand erie canal you
must have heard of it

nay senor hereabouts in this dull warm most lazy and hereditary
land we know but little of your vigorous north

aye well then don refill my cup your chichas very fine and
ere proceeding further i will tell ye what our canallers are for such
information may throw sidelight upon my story

for three hundred and sixty miles gentlemen through the entire
breadth of the state of new york through numerous populous cities and
most thriving villages through long dismal uninhabited swamps and
affluent cultivated fields unrivalled for fertility by billiardroom
and barroom through the holyofholies of great forests on roman
arches over indian rivers through sun and shade by happy hearts or
broken through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble mohawk
counties and especially by rows of snowwhite chapels whose spires
stand almost like milestones flows one continual stream of venetianly
corrupt and often lawless life theres your true ashantee gentlemen
there howl your pagans where you ever find them next door to you
under the longflung shadow and the snug patronising lee of churches
for by some curious fatality as it is often noted of your metropolitan
freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice so
sinners gentlemen most abound in holiest vicinities

is that a friar passing said don pedro looking downwards into the
crowded plazza with humorous concern

well for our northern friend dame isabellas inquisition wanes in
lima laughed don sebastian proceed senor

a moment pardon cried another of the company in the name of all
us limeese i but desire to express to you sir sailor that we have by
no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present lima
for distant venice in your corrupt comparison oh do not bow and look
surprised you know the proverb all along this coastcorrupt as
lima it but bears out your saying too churches more plentiful than
billiardtables and for ever openand corrupt as lima so too
venice i have been there the holy city of the blessed evangelist st
markst dominic purge it your cup thanks here i refill now you
pour out again

freely depicted in his own vocation gentlemen the canaller would make
a fine dramatic hero so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he like
mark antony for days and days along his greenturfed flowery nile
he indolently floats openly toying with his redcheeked cleopatra
ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck but ashore all this
effeminacy is dashed the brigandish guise which the canaller so proudly
sports his slouched and gailyribboned hat betoken his grand features
a terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he
floats his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities
once a vagabond on his own canal i have received good turns from one of
these canallers i thank him heartily would fain be not ungrateful
but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of
violence that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger
in a strait as to plunder a wealthy one in sum gentlemen what the
wildness of this canal life is is emphatically evinced by this that
our wild whalefishery contains so many of its most finished graduates
and that scarce any race of mankind except sydney men are so much
distrusted by our whaling captains nor does it at all diminish the
curiousness of this matter that to many thousands of our rural boys and
young men born along its line the probationary life of the grand canal
furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a christian
cornfield and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric
seas

i see i see impetuously exclaimed don pedro spilling his chicha
upon his silvery ruffles no need to travel the worlds one lima i
had thought now that at your temperate north the generations were cold
and holy as the hillsbut the story

i left off gentlemen where the lakeman shook the backstay hardly
had he done so when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the
four harpooneers who all crowded him to the deck but sliding down the
ropes like baleful comets the two canallers rushed into the uproar and
sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle others of the
sailors joined with them in this attempt and a twisted turmoil ensued
while standing out of harms way the valiant captain danced up and down
with a whalepike calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious
scoundrel and smoke him along to the quarterdeck at intervals he ran
close up to the revolving border of the confusion and prying into
the heart of it with his pike sought to prick out the object of his
resentment but steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them
all they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck where hastily
slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass
these seaparisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade

come out of that ye pirates roared the captain now menacing them
with a pistol in each hand just brought to him by the steward come
out of that ye cutthroats

steelkilt leaped on the barricade and striding up and down there
defied the worst the pistols could do but gave the captain to
understand distinctly that his steelkilts death would be the signal
for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands fearing in his heart
lest this might prove but too true the captain a little desisted but
still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty

will you promise not to touch us if we do demanded their
ringleader

turn to turn toi make no promiseto your duty do you want to
sink the ship by knocking off at a time like this turn to and he
once more raised a pistol

sink the ship cried steelkilt aye let her sink not a man of us
turns to unless you swear not to raise a ropeyarn against us what say
ye men turning to his comrades a fierce cheer was their response

the lakeman now patrolled the barricade all the while keeping his eye
on the captain and jerking out such sentences as theseits not our
fault we didnt want it i told him to take his hammer away it was
boys business he might have known me before this i told him not to
prick the buffalo i believe i have broken a finger here against his
cursed jaw aint those mincing knives down in the forecastle there
men look to those handspikes my hearties captain by god look to
yourself say the word dont be a fool forget it all we are ready
to turn to treat us decently and were your men but we wont be
flogged

turn to i make no promises turn to i say

look ye now cried the lakeman flinging out his arm towards him
there are a few of us here and i am one of them who have shipped
for the cruise dye see now as you well know sir we can claim our
discharge as soon as the anchor is down so we dont want a row its
not our interest we want to be peaceable we are ready to work but we
wont be flogged

turn to roared the captain

steelkilt glanced round him a moment and then saidi tell you what
it is now captain rather than kill ye and be hung for such a shabby
rascal we wont lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us but till
you say the word about not flogging us we dont do a hands turn

down into the forecastle then down with ye ill keep ye there till
yere sick of it down ye go

shall we cried the ringleader to his men most of them were against
it but at length in obedience to steelkilt they preceded him down
into their dark den growlingly disappearing like bears into a cave

as the lakemans bare head was just level with the planks the captain
and his posse leaped the barricade and rapidly drawing over the slide
of the scuttle planted their group of hands upon it and loudly called
for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the
companionway

then opening the slide a little the captain whispered something
down the crack closed it and turned the key upon themten in
numberleaving on deck some twenty or more who thus far had remained
neutral

all night a wideawake watch was kept by all the officers forward and
aft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway at which
last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge after breaking
through the bulkhead below but the hours of darkness passed in peace
the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps
whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night
dismally resounded through the ship

at sunrise the captain went forward and knocking on the deck summoned
the prisoners to work but with a yell they refused water was then
lowered down to them and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed
after it when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it the
captain returned to the quarterdeck twice every day for three days
this was repeated but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling and
then a scuffling was heard as the customary summons was delivered and
suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle saying they were ready
to turn to the fetid closeness of the air and a famishing diet united
perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution had constrained them to
surrender at discretion emboldened by this the captain reiterated his
demand to the rest but steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to
stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged on the fifth
morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the
desperate arms below that sought to restrain them only three were left

better turn to now said the captain with a heartless jeer

shut us up again will ye cried steelkilt

oh certainly the captain and the key clicked

it was at this point gentlemen that enraged by the defection of seven
of his former associates and stung by the mocking voice that had last
hailed him and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as
the bowels of despair it was then that steelkilt proposed to the two
canallers thus far apparently of one mind with him to burst out of
their hole at the next summoning of the garrison and armed with their
keen mincing knives long crescentic heavy implements with a handle
at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and if by any
devilishness of desperation possible seize the ship for himself he
would do this he said whether they joined him or not that was the
last night he should spend in that den but the scheme met with no
opposition on the part of the other two they swore they were ready for
that or for any other mad thing for anything in short but a surrender
and what was more they each insisted upon being the first man on deck
when the time to make the rush should come but to this their leader as
fiercely objected reserving that priority for himself particularly as
his two comrades would not yield the one to the other in the matter
and both of them could not be first for the ladder would but admit one
man at a time and here gentlemen the foul play of these miscreants
must come out

upon hearing the frantic project of their leader each in his own
separate soul had suddenly lighted it would seem upon the same piece
of treachery namely to be foremost in breaking out in order to be
the first of the three though the last of the ten to surrender and
thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit
but when steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to
the last they in some way by some subtle chemistry of villany mixed
their before secret treacheries together and when their leader
fell into a doze verbally opened their souls to each other in three
sentences and bound the sleeper with cords and gagged him with cords
and shrieked out for the captain at midnight

thinking murder at hand and smelling in the dark for the blood he and
all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle in a
few minutes the scuttle was opened and bound hand and foot the still
struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious
allies who at once claimed the honour of securing a man who had been
fully ripe for murder but all these were collared and dragged along
the deck like dead cattle and side by side were seized up into the
mizzen rigging like three quarters of meat and there they hung till
morning damn ye cried the captain pacing to and fro before them
the vultures would not touch ye ye villains

at sunrise he summoned all hands and separating those who had rebelled
from those who had taken no part in the mutiny he told the former that
he had a good mind to flog them all roundthought upon the whole
he would do sohe ought tojustice demanded it but for the present
considering their timely surrender he would let them go with a
reprimand which he accordingly administered in the vernacular

but as for you ye carrion rogues turning to the three men in the
riggingfor you i mean to mince ye up for the trypots and
seizing a rope he applied it with all his might to the backs of the
two traitors till they yelled no more but lifelessly hung their heads
sideways as the two crucified thieves are drawn

my wrist is sprained with ye he cried at last but there is still
rope enough left for you my fine bantam that wouldnt give up take
that gag from his mouth and let us hear what he can say for himself

for a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his
cramped jaws and then painfully twisting round his head said in a sort
of hiss what i say is thisand mind it wellif you flog me i murder
you

say ye so then see how ye frighten meand the captain drew off with
the rope to strike

best not hissed the lakeman

but i mustand the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke

steelkilt here hissed out something inaudible to all but the captain
who to the amazement of all hands started back paced the deck rapidly
two or three times and then suddenly throwing down his rope said i
wont do itlet him gocut him down dye hear

but as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order a pale man
with a bandaged head arrested themradney the chief mate ever since
the blow he had lain in his berth but that morning hearing the tumult
on the deck he had crept out and thus far had watched the whole
scene such was the state of his mouth that he could hardly speak
but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the
captain dared not attempt he snatched the rope and advanced to his
pinioned foe

you are a coward hissed the lakeman

so i am but take that the mate was in the very act of striking
when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm he paused and then pausing
no more made good his word spite of steelkilts threat whatever that
might have been the three men were then cut down all hands were turned
to and sullenly worked by the moody seamen the iron pumps clanged as
before

just after dark that day when one watch had retired below a clamor
was heard in the forecastle and the two trembling traitors running up
besieged the cabin door saying they durst not consort with the crew
entreaties cuffs and kicks could not drive them back so at their own
instance they were put down in the ships run for salvation still no
sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest on the contrary it seemed
that mainly at steelkilts instigation they had resolved to maintain
the strictest peacefulness obey all orders to the last and when the
ship reached port desert her in a body but in order to insure the
speediest end to the voyage they all agreed to another thingnamely
not to sing out for whales in case any should be discovered for
spite of her leak and spite of all her other perils the townho still
maintained her mastheads and her captain was just as willing to
lower for a fish that moment as on the day his craft first struck the
cruising ground and radney the mate was quite as ready to change his
berth for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the
vital jaw of the whale

but though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of
passiveness in their conduct he kept his own counsel at least till all
was over concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who
had stung him in the ventricles of his heart he was in radney the chief
mates watch and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than
half way to meet his doom after the scene at the rigging he insisted
against the express counsel of the captain upon resuming the head
of his watch at night upon this and one or two other circumstances
steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge

during the night radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the
bulwarks of the quarterdeck and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of
the boat which was hoisted up there a little above the ships side
in this attitude it was well known he sometimes dozed there was a
considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship and down between
this was the sea steelkilt calculated his time and found that his next
trick at the helm would come round at two oclock in the morning of the
third day from that in which he had been betrayed at his leisure
he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his
watches below

what are you making there said a shipmate

what do you think what does it look like

like a lanyard for your bag but its an odd one seems to me

yes rather oddish said the lakeman holding it at arms length
before him but i think it will answer shipmate i havent enough
twinehave you any

but there was none in the forecastle

then i must get some from old rad and he rose to go aft

you dont mean to go a begging to him said a sailor

why not do you think he wont do me a turn when its to help himself
in the end shipmate and going to the mate he looked at him
quietly and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock it was given
himneither twine nor lanyard were seen again but the next night
an iron ball closely netted partly rolled from the pocket of the
lakemans monkey jacket as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for
a pillow twentyfour hours after his trick at the silent helmnigh
to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to
the seamans handthat fatal hour was then to come and in the
foreordaining soul of steelkilt the mate was already stark and
stretched as a corpse with his forehead crushed in

but gentlemen a fool saved the wouldbe murderer from the bloody
deed he had planned yet complete revenge he had and without being the
avenger for by a mysterious fatality heaven itself seemed to step in
to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have
done

it was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second
day when they were washing down the decks that a stupid teneriffe man
drawing water in the mainchains all at once shouted out there she
rolls there she rolls jesu what a whale it was moby dick

moby dick cried don sebastian st dominic sir sailor but do
whales have christenings whom call you moby dick

a very white and famous and most deadly immortal monster donbut
that would be too long a story

how how cried all the young spaniards crowding

nay dons donsnay nay i cannot rehearse that now let me get more
into the air sirs

the chicha the chicha cried don pedro our vigorous friend looks
faintfill up his empty glass

no need gentlemen one moment and i proceednow gentlemen
so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the
shipforgetful of the compact among the crewin the excitement of the
moment the teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted
his voice for the monster though for some little time past it had been
plainly beheld from the three sullen mastheads all was now a phrensy
the white whalethe white whale was the cry from captain mates
and harpooneers who undeterred by fearful rumours were all anxious
to capture so famous and precious a fish while the dogged crew eyed
askance and with curses the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass
that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun shifted and glistened like
a living opal in the blue morning sea gentlemen a strange fatality
pervades the whole career of these events as if verily mapped out
before the world itself was charted the mutineer was the bowsman of the
mate and when fast to a fish it was his duty to sit next him while
radney stood up with his lance in the prow and haul in or slacken
the line at the word of command moreover when the four boats were
lowered the mates got the start and none howled more fiercely with
delight than did steelkilt as he strained at his oar after a stiff
pull their harpooneer got fast and spear in hand radney sprang to
the bow he was always a furious man it seems in a boat and now his
bandaged cry was to beach him on the whales topmost back nothing
loath his bowsman hauled him up and up through a blinding foam that
blent two whitenesses together till of a sudden the boat struck as
against a sunken ledge and keeling over spilled out the standing mate
that instant as he fell on the whales slippery back the boat righted
and was dashed aside by the swell while radney was tossed over into the
sea on the other flank of the whale he struck out through the spray
and for an instant was dimly seen through that veil wildly seeking to
remove himself from the eye of moby dick but the whale rushed round
in a sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer between his jaws and rearing
high up with him plunged headlong again and went down

meantime at the first tap of the boats bottom the lakeman had
slackened the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calmly
looking on he thought his own thoughts but a sudden terrific
downward jerking of the boat quickly brought his knife to the line he
cut it and the whale was free but at some distance moby dick rose
again with some tatters of radneys red woollen shirt caught in the
teeth that had destroyed him all four boats gave chase again but the
whale eluded them and finally wholly disappeared

in good time the townho reached her porta savage solitary
placewhere no civilized creature resided there headed by the
lakeman all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted
among the palms eventually as it turned out seizing a large double
warcanoe of the savages and setting sail for some other harbor

the ships company being reduced to but a handful the captain called
upon the islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving
down the ship to stop the leak but to such unresting vigilance over
their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated both
by night and by day and so extreme was the hard work they underwent
that upon the vessel being ready again for sea they were in such a
weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so
heavy a vessel after taking counsel with his officers he anchored the
ship as far off shore as possible loaded and ran out his two cannon
from the bows stacked his muskets on the poop and warning the
islanders not to approach the ship at their peril took one man with
him and setting the sail of his best whaleboat steered straight
before the wind for tahiti five hundred miles distant to procure a
reinforcement to his crew

on the fourth day of the sail a large canoe was descried which seemed
to have touched at a low isle of corals he steered away from it but
the savage craft bore down on him and soon the voice of steelkilt
hailed him to heave to or he would run him under water the captain
presented a pistol with one foot on each prow of the yoked warcanoes
the lakeman laughed him to scorn assuring him that if the pistol so
much as clicked in the lock he would bury him in bubbles and foam

what do you want of me cried the captain

where are you bound and for what are you bound demanded steelkilt
no lies

i am bound to tahiti for more men

very good let me board you a momenti come in peace with that he
leaped from the canoe swam to the boat and climbing the gunwale stood
face to face with the captain

cross your arms sir throw back your head now repeat after me
as soon as steelkilt leaves me i swear to beach this boat on yonder
island and remain there six days if i do not may lightning strike
me

a pretty scholar laughed the lakeman adios senor and leaping
into the sea he swam back to his comrades

watching the boat till it was fairly beached and drawn up to the
roots of the cocoanut trees steelkilt made sail again and in due time
arrived at tahiti his own place of destination there luck befriended
him two ships were about to sail for france and were providentially
in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed they
embarked and so for ever got the start of their former captain had he
been at all minded to work them legal retribution

some ten days after the french ships sailed the whaleboat arrived
and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized
tahitians who had been somewhat used to the sea chartering a small
native schooner he returned with them to his vessel and finding all
right there again resumed his cruisings

where steelkilt now is gentlemen none know but upon the island of
nantucket the widow of radney still turns to the sea which refuses
to give up its dead still in dreams sees the awful white whale that
destroyed him

are you through said don sebastian quietly

i am don

then i entreat you tell me if to the best of your own convictions
this your story is in substance really true it is so passing wonderful
did you get it from an unquestionable source bear with me if i seem to
press

also bear with all of us sir sailor for we all join in don
sebastians suit cried the company with exceeding interest

is there a copy of the holy evangelists in the golden inn gentlemen

nay said don sebastian but i know a worthy priest near by who
will quickly procure one for me i go for it but are you well advised
this may grow too serious

will you be so good as to bring the priest also don

though there are no autodafes in lima now said one of the company
to another i fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy
let us withdraw more out of the moonlight i see no need of this

excuse me for running after you don sebastian but may i also beg
that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized evangelists
you can

this is the priest he brings you the evangelists said don sebastian
gravely returning with a tall and solemn figure

let me remove my hat now venerable priest further into the light
and hold the holy book before me that i may touch it

so help me heaven and on my honour the story i have told ye
gentlemen is in substance and its great items true i know it to be
true it happened on this ball i trod the ship i knew the crew i have
seen and talked with steelkilt since the death of radney



chapter 55 of the monstrous pictures of whales


i shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas
something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the
eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored
alongside the whaleship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there
it may be worth while therefore previously to advert to those
curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day
confidently challenge the faith of the landsman it is time to set the
world right in this matter by proving such pictures of the whale all
wrong

it may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will
be found among the oldest hindoo egyptian and grecian sculptures for
ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble
panellings of temples the pedestals of statues and on shields
medallions cups and coins the dolphin was drawn in scales of
chainarmor like saladins and a helmeted head like st georges ever
since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed not
only in most popular pictures of the whale but in many scientific
presentations of him

now by all odds the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to
be the whales is to be found in the famous cavernpagoda of elephanta
in india the brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of
that immemorial pagoda all the trades and pursuits every conceivable
avocation of man were prefigured ages before any of them actually came
into being no wonder then that in some sort our noble profession of
whaling should have been there shadowed forth the hindoo whale
referred to occurs in a separate department of the wall depicting the
incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedly known as the
matse avatar but though this sculpture is half man and half whale so
as only to give the tail of the latter yet that small section of him is
all wrong it looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda than the
broad palms of the true whales majestic flukes

but go to the old galleries and look now at a great christian painters
portrait of this fish for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian
hindoo it is guidos picture of perseus rescuing andromeda from the
seamonster or whale where did guido get the model of such a strange
creature as that nor does hogarth in painting the same scene in his
own perseus descending make out one whit better the huge corpulence
of that hogarthian monster undulates on the surface scarcely drawing
one inch of water it has a sort of howdah on its back and its
distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling might be
taken for the traitors gate leading from the thames by water into the
tower then there are the prodromus whales of old scotch sibbald and
jonahs whale as depicted in the prints of old bibles and the cuts of
old primers what shall be said of these as for the bookbinders whale
winding like a vinestalk round the stock of a descending anchoras
stamped and gilded on the backs and titlepages of many books both
old and newthat is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature
imitated i take it from the like figures on antique vases
though universally denominated a dolphin i nevertheless call this
bookbinders fish an attempt at a whale because it was so intended
when the device was first introduced it was introduced by an old
italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century during the revival
of learning and in those days and even down to a comparatively
late period dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the
leviathan

in the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will
at times meet with very curious touches at the whale where all manner
of spouts jets deau hot springs and cold saratoga and badenbaden
come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain in the titlepage of the
original edition of the advancement of learning you will find some
curious whales

but quitting all these unprofessional attempts let us glance at those
pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober scientific delineations
by those who know in old harriss collection of voyages there are some
plates of whales extracted from a dutch book of voyages ad 1671
entitled a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in the
whale peter peterson of friesland master in one of those plates the
whales like great rafts of logs are represented lying among iceisles
with white bears running over their living backs in another plate the
prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular
flukes

then again there is an imposing quarto written by one captain colnett
a post captain in the english navy entitled a voyage round cape horn
into the south seas for the purpose of extending the spermaceti whale
fisheries in this book is an outline purporting to be a picture of
a physeter or spermaceti whale drawn by scale from one killed on the
coast of mexico august 1793 and hoisted on deck i doubt not the
captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines
to mention but one thing about it let me say that it has an eye which
applied according to the accompanying scale to a full grown sperm
whale would make the eye of that whale a bowwindow some five feet
long ah my gallant captain why did ye not give us jonah looking out
of that eye

nor are the most conscientious compilations of natural history for
the benefit of the young and tender free from the same heinousness of
mistake look at that popular work goldsmiths animated nature in the
abridged london edition of 1807 there are plates of an alleged whale
and a narwhale i do not wish to seem inelegant but this unsightly
whale looks much like an amputated sow and as for the narwhale one
glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that in this nineteenth century
such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent
public of schoolboys

then again in 1825 bernard germain count de lacepede a great
naturalist published a scientific systemized whale book wherein are
several pictures of the different species of the leviathan all these
are not only incorrect but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland
whale that is to say the right whale even scoresby a long
experienced man as touching that species declares not to have its
counterpart in nature

but the placing of the capsheaf to all this blundering business was
reserved for the scientific frederick cuvier brother to the famous
baron in 1836 he published a natural history of whales in which he
gives what he calls a picture of the sperm whale before showing that
picture to any nantucketer you had best provide for your summary
retreat from nantucket in a word frederick cuviers sperm whale is not
a sperm whale but a squash of course he never had the benefit of
a whaling voyage such men seldom have but whence he derived that
picture who can tell perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor
in the same field desmarest got one of his authentic abortions that
is from a chinese drawing and what sort of lively lads with the pencil
those chinese are many queer cups and saucers inform us

as for the signpainters whales seen in the streets hanging over the
shops of oildealers what shall be said of them they are generally
richard iii whales with dromedary humps and very savage breakfasting
on three or four sailor tarts that is whaleboats full of mariners
their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint

but these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very
surprising after all consider most of the scientific drawings have
been taken from the stranded fish and these are about as correct as a
drawing of a wrecked ship with broken back would correctly represent
the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars
though elephants have stood for their fulllengths the living leviathan
has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait the living whale
in his full majesty and significance is only to be seen at sea in
unfathomable waters and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight
like a launched lineofbattle ship and out of that element it is a
thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the
air so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations and not
to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young
sucking whale and a fullgrown platonian leviathan yet even in the
case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ships deck such
is then the outlandish eellike limbered varying shape of him that
his precise expression the devil himself could not catch

but it may be fancied that from the naked skeleton of the stranded
whale accurate hints may be derived touching his true form not at all
for it is one of the more curious things about this leviathan that
his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape though jeremy
benthams skeleton which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of
his executors correctly conveys the idea of a burlybrowed utilitarian
old gentleman with all jeremys other leading personal characteristics
yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathans
articulated bones in fact as the great hunter says the mere skeleton
of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded
animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes
it this peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head as in some
part of this book will be incidentally shown it is also very curiously
displayed in the side fin the bones of which almost exactly answer to
the bones of the human hand minus only the thumb this fin has four
regular bonefingers the index middle ring and little finger but
all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering as the human
fingers in an artificial covering however recklessly the whale may
sometimes serve us said humorous stubb one day he can never be truly
said to handle us without mittens

for all these reasons then any way you may look at it you must needs
conclude that the great leviathan is that one creature in the world
which must remain unpainted to the last true one portrait may hit
the mark much nearer than another but none can hit it with any very
considerable degree of exactness so there is no earthly way of finding
out precisely what the whale really looks like and the only mode in
which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour is
by going a whaling yourself but by so doing you run no small risk of
being eternally stove and sunk by him wherefore it seems to me you had
best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this leviathan



chapter 56 of the less erroneous pictures of whales and the true
pictures of whaling scenes


in connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales i am strongly
tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of
them which are to be found in certain books both ancient and modern
especially in pliny purchas hackluyt harris cuvier etc but i pass
that matter by

i know of only four published outlines of the great sperm whale
colnetts hugginss frederick cuviers and beales in the previous
chapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to hugginss is far
better than theirs but by great odds beales is the best all beales
drawings of this whale are good excepting the middle figure in the
picture of three whales in various attitudes capping his second
chapter his frontispiece boats attacking sperm whales though no
doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men is
admirably correct and lifelike in its general effect some of the sperm
whale drawings in j ross browne are pretty correct in contour but they
are wretchedly engraved that is not his fault though

of the right whale the best outline pictures are in scoresby but they
are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression he has
but one picture of whaling scenes and this is a sad deficiency because
it is by such pictures only when at all well done that you can derive
anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living
hunters

but taken for all in all by far the finest though in some details
not the most correct presentations of whales and whaling scenes to
be anywhere found are two large french engravings well executed
and taken from paintings by one garnery respectively they represent
attacks on the sperm and right whale in the first engraving a noble
sperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might just risen beneath
the boat from the profundities of the ocean and bearing high in the air
upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks the prow of
the boat is partially unbroken and is drawn just balancing upon
the monsters spine and standing in that prow for that one single
incomputable flash of time you behold an oarsman half shrouded by the
incensed boiling spout of the whale and in the act of leaping as if
from a precipice the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and
true the halfemptied linetub floats on the whitened sea the wooden
poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it the heads of the
swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions
of affright while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down
upon the scene serious fault might be found with the anatomical details
of this whale but let that pass since for the life of me i could not
draw so good a one

in the second engraving the boat is in the act of drawing alongside
the barnacled flank of a large running right whale that rolls his black
weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rockslide from the patagonian
cliffs his jets are erect full and black like soot so that from so
abounding a smoke in the chimney you would think there must be a brave
supper cooking in the great bowels below sea fowls are pecking at the
small crabs shellfish and other sea candies and maccaroni which the
right whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back and all the while
the thicklipped leviathan is rushing through the deep leaving tons of
tumultuous white curds in his wake and causing the slight boat to rock
in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddlewheels of an ocean
steamer thus the foreground is all raging commotion but behind in
admirable artistic contrast is the glassy level of a sea becalmed the
drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship and the inert mass of
a dead whale a conquered fortress with the flag of capture lazily
hanging from the whalepole inserted into his spouthole

who garnery the painter is or was i know not but my life for it he
was either practically conversant with his subject or else marvellously
tutored by some experienced whaleman the french are the lads for
painting action go and gaze upon all the paintings of europe and
where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion
on canvas as in that triumphal hall at versailles where the beholder
fights his way pellmell through the consecutive great battles of
france where every sword seems a flash of the northern lights and the
successive armed kings and emperors dash by like a charge of crowned
centaurs not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery are these sea
battlepieces of garnery

the natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesqueness of
things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings
they have of their whaling scenes with not one tenth of englands
experience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of the
americans they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only
finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of
the whale hunt for the most part the english and american whale
draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline
of things such as the vacant profile of the whale which so far as
picturesqueness of effect is concerned is about tantamount to sketching
the profile of a pyramid even scoresby the justly renowned right
whaleman after giving us a stiff full length of the greenland whale
and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises treats
us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks chopping knives
and grapnels and with the microscopic diligence of a leuwenhoeck
submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninetysix facsimiles of
magnified arctic snow crystals i mean no disparagement to the excellent
voyager i honour him for a veteran but in so important a matter it
was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a
sworn affidavit taken before a greenland justice of the peace

in addition to those fine engravings from garnery there are two other
french engravings worthy of note by some one who subscribes himself
h durand one of them though not precisely adapted to our present
purpose nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts it is a quiet
noonscene among the isles of the pacific a french whaler anchored
inshore in a calm and lazily taking water on board the loosened sails
of the ship and the long leaves of the palms in the background both
drooping together in the breezeless air the effect is very fine when
considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under
one of their few aspects of oriental repose the other engraving is
quite a different affair the ship hoveto upon the open sea and in the
very heart of the leviathanic life with a right whale alongside the
vessel in the act of cuttingin hove over to the monster as if to a
quay and a boat hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity is
about giving chase to whales in the distance the harpoons and lances
lie levelled for use three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its
hole while from a sudden roll of the sea the little craft stands
halferect out of the water like a rearing horse from the ship the
smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke
over a village of smithies and to windward a black cloud rising up
with earnest of squalls and rains seems to quicken the activity of the
excited seamen



chapter 57 of whales in paint in teeth in wood in sheetiron in
stone in mountains in stars


on towerhill as you go down to the london docks you may have seen a
crippled beggar or kedger as the sailors say holding a painted board
before him representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg
there are three whales and three boats and one of the boats presumed
to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity is being
crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale any time these ten years
they tell me has that man held up that picture and exhibited that
stump to an incredulous world but the time of his justification has
now come his three whales are as good whales as were ever published in
wapping at any rate and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you
will find in the western clearings but though for ever mounted on
that stump never a stumpspeech does the poor whaleman make but with
downcast eyes stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation

throughout the pacific and also in nantucket and new bedford and
sag harbor you will come across lively sketches of whales and
whalingscenes graven by the fishermen themselves on sperm whaleteeth
or ladies busks wrought out of the right whalebone and other
like skrimshander articles as the whalemen call the numerous little
ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material
in their hours of ocean leisure some of them have little boxes
of dentisticallooking implements specially intended for the
skrimshandering business but in general they toil with their
jackknives alone and with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor
they will turn you out anything you please in the way of a mariners
fancy

long exile from christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man
to that condition in which god placed him ie what is called savagery
your true whalehunter is as much a savage as an iroquois i myself am a
savage owning no allegiance but to the king of the cannibals and ready
at any moment to rebel against him

now one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic
hours is his wonderful patience of industry an ancient hawaiian
warclub or spearpaddle in its full multiplicity and elaboration of
carving is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a latin lexicon
for with but a bit of broken seashell or a sharks tooth that
miraculous intricacy of wooden network has been achieved and it has
cost steady years of steady application

as with the hawaiian savage so with the white sailorsavage with the
same marvellous patience and with the same single sharks tooth of
his one poor jackknife he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture not
quite as workmanlike but as close packed in its maziness of design
as the greek savage achilless shield and full of barbaric spirit
and suggestiveness as the prints of that fine old dutch savage albert
durer

wooden whales or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of
the noble south sea warwood are frequently met with in the forecastles
of american whalers some of them are done with much accuracy

at some old gableroofed country houses you will see brass whales hung
by the tail for knockers to the roadside door when the porter is
sleepy the anvilheaded whale would be best but these knocking
whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays on the spires of some
oldfashioned churches you will see sheetiron whales placed there for
weathercocks but they are so elevated and besides that are to all
intents and purposes so labelled with hands off you cannot examine
them closely enough to decide upon their merit

in bony ribby regions of the earth where at the base of high broken
cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the
plain you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the
leviathan partly merged in grass which of a windy day breaks against
them in a surf of green surges

then again in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually
girdled by amphitheatrical heights here and there from some lucky
point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of
whales defined along the undulating ridges but you must be a thorough
whaleman to see these sights and not only that but if you wish
to return to such a sight again you must be sure and take the exact
intersecting latitude and longitude of your first standpoint else
so chancelike are such observations of the hills that your precise
previous standpoint would require a laborious rediscovery like the
soloma islands which still remain incognita though once highruffed
mendanna trod them and old figuera chronicled them

nor when expandingly lifted by your subject can you fail to trace out
great whales in the starry heavens and boats in pursuit of them as
when long filled with thoughts of war the eastern nations saw armies
locked in battle among the clouds thus at the north have i chased
leviathan round and round the pole with the revolutions of the bright
points that first defined him to me and beneath the effulgent antarctic
skies i have boarded the argonavis and joined the chase against the
starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydrus and the flying
fish

with a frigates anchors for my bridlebitts and fasces of harpoons for
spurs would i could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies to
see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie
encamped beyond my mortal sight



chapter 58 brit


steering northeastward from the crozetts we fell in with vast meadows
of brit the minute yellow substance upon which the right whale
largely feeds for leagues and leagues it undulated round us so that we
seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat

on the second day numbers of right whales were seen who secure from
the attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod with open jaws sluggishly
swam through the brit which adhering to the fringing fibres of that
wondrous venetian blind in their mouths was in that manner separated
from the water that escaped at the lip

as morning mowers who side by side slowly and seethingly advance
their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads even so these
monsters swam making a strange grassy cutting sound and leaving
behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea


that part of the sea known among whalemen as the brazil banks does
not bear that name as the banks of newfoundland do because of there
being shallows and soundings there but because of this remarkable
meadowlike appearance caused by the vast drifts of brit continually
floating in those latitudes where the right whale is often chased


but it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all
reminded one of mowers seen from the mastheads especially when they
paused and were stationary for a while their vast black forms looked
more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else and as in the
great hunting countries of india the stranger at a distance will
sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them
to be such taking them for bare blackened elevations of the soil even
so often with him who for the first time beholds this species of the
leviathans of the sea and even when recognised at last their immense
magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses
of overgrowth can possibly be instinct in all parts with the same sort
of life that lives in a dog or a horse

indeed in other respects you can hardly regard any creatures of the
deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore for though
some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are
of their kind in the sea and though taking a broad general view of
the thing this may very well be yet coming to specialties where for
example does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to
the sagacious kindness of the dog the accursed shark alone can in any
generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him

but though to landsmen in general the native inhabitants of the
seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and
repelling though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita
so that columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his
one superficial western one though by vast odds the most terrific
of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen
tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters
though but a moments consideration will teach that however baby man
may brag of his science and skill and however much in a flattering
future that science and skill may augment yet for ever and for ever
to the crack of doom the sea will insult and murder him and pulverize
the stateliest stiffest frigate he can make nevertheless by the
continual repetition of these very impressions man has lost that sense
of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it

the first boat we read of floated on an ocean that with portuguese
vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow
that same ocean rolls now that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships
of last year yea foolish mortals noahs flood is not yet subsided
two thirds of the fair world it yet covers

wherein differ the sea and the land that a miracle upon one is not a
miracle upon the other preternatural terrors rested upon the hebrews
when under the feet of korah and his company the live ground opened
and swallowed them up for ever yet not a modern sun ever sets but in
precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews

but not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it but it
is also a fiend to its own offspring worse than the persian host who
murdered his own guests sparing not the creatures which itself hath
spawned like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her
own cubs so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks
and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships no
mercy no power but its own controls it panting and snorting like a mad
battle steed that has lost its rider the masterless ocean overruns the
globe

consider the subtleness of the sea how its most dreaded creatures glide
under water unapparent for the most part and treacherously hidden
beneath the loveliest tints of azure consider also the devilish
brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes as the
dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks consider once more
the universal cannibalism of the sea all whose creatures prey upon each
other carrying on eternal war since the world began

consider all this and then turn to this green gentle and most docile
earth consider them both the sea and the land and do you not find a
strange analogy to something in yourself for as this appalling ocean
surrounds the verdant land so in the soul of man there lies one insular
tahiti full of peace and joy but encompassed by all the horrors of the
half known life god keep thee push not off from that isle thou canst
never return


chapter 59 squid


slowly wading through the meadows of brit the pequod still held on her
way northeastward towards the island of java a gentle air impelling
her keel so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering
masts mildly waved to that languid breeze as three mild palms on a
plain and still at wide intervals in the silvery night the lonely
alluring jet would be seen

but one transparent blue morning when a stillness almost preternatural
spread over the sea however unattended with any stagnant calm when
the long burnished sunglade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid
across them enjoining some secrecy when the slippered waves whispered
together as they softly ran on in this profound hush of the visible
sphere a strange spectre was seen by daggoo from the mainmasthead

in the distance a great white mass lazily rose and rising higher and
higher and disentangling itself from the azure at last gleamed before
our prow like a snowslide new slid from the hills thus glistening
for a moment as slowly it subsided and sank then once more arose
and silently gleamed it seemed not a whale and yet is this moby dick
thought daggoo again the phantom went down but on reappearing once
more with a stilettolike cry that startled every man from his nod the
negro yelled outthere there again there she breaches right ahead
the white whale the white whale

upon this the seamen rushed to the yardarms as in swarmingtime the
bees rush to the boughs bareheaded in the sultry sun ahab stood on
the bowsprit and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave
his orders to the helmsman cast his eager glance in the direction
indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of daggoo

whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had
gradually worked upon ahab so that he was now prepared to connect the
ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular
whale he pursued however this was or whether his eagerness betrayed
him whichever way it might have been no sooner did he distinctly
perceive the white mass than with a quick intensity he instantly gave
orders for lowering

the four boats were soon on the water ahabs in advance and all
swiftly pulling towards their prey soon it went down and while with
oars suspended we were awaiting its reappearance lo in the same
spot where it sank once more it slowly rose almost forgetting for
the moment all thoughts of moby dick we now gazed at the most wondrous
phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind
a vast pulpy mass furlongs in length and breadth of a glancing
creamcolour lay floating on the water innumerable long arms radiating
from its centre and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas as
if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach no perceptible
face or front did it have no conceivable token of either sensation or
instinct but undulated there on the billows an unearthly formless
chancelike apparition of life

as with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again starbuck still
gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk with a wild voice
exclaimedalmost rather had i seen moby dick and fought him than to
have seen thee thou white ghost

what was it sir said flask

the great live squid which they say few whaleships ever beheld and
returned to their ports to tell of it

but ahab said nothing turning his boat he sailed back to the vessel
the rest as silently following

whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with
the sight of this object certain it is that a glimpse of it being
so very unusual that circumstance has gone far to invest it with
portentousness so rarely is it beheld that though one and all of them
declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean yet very few
of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and
form notwithstanding they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale
his only food for though other species of whales find their food above
water and may be seen by man in the act of feeding the spermaceti
whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface and
only by inference is it that any one can tell of what precisely that
food consists at times when closely pursued he will disgorge what
are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid some of them thus
exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length they fancy that
the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to
the bed of the ocean and that the sperm whale unlike other species is
supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it

there seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop
pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into squid the manner in
which the bishop describes it as alternately rising and sinking with
some other particulars he narrates in all this the two correspond
but much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he
assigns it

by some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious
creature here spoken of it is included among the class of cuttlefish
to which indeed in certain external respects it would seem to belong
but only as the anak of the tribe



chapter 60 the line


with reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described as well as
for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented
i have here to speak of the magical sometimes horrible whaleline

the line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp slightly
vapoured with tar not impregnated with it as in the case of ordinary
ropes for while tar as ordinarily used makes the hemp more pliable to
the ropemaker and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the
sailor for common ship use yet not only would the ordinary quantity
too much stiffen the whaleline for the close coiling to which it must
be subjected but as most seamen are beginning to learn tar in general
by no means adds to the ropes durability or strength however much it
may give it compactness and gloss

of late years the manilla rope has in the american fishery almost
entirely superseded hemp as a material for whalelines for though not
so durable as hemp it is stronger and far more soft and elastic and
i will add since there is an aesthetics in all things is much more
handsome and becoming to the boat than hemp hemp is a dusky dark
fellow a sort of indian but manilla is as a goldenhaired circassian
to behold

the whaleline is only twothirds of an inch in thickness at first
sight you would not think it so strong as it really is by experiment
its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and
twenty pounds so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal
to three tons in length the common sperm whaleline measures something
over two hundred fathoms towards the stern of the boat it is spirally
coiled away in the tub not like the wormpipe of a still though but so
as to form one round cheeseshaped mass of densely bedded sheaves or
layers of concentric spiralizations without any hollow but the heart
or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese as the least
tangle or kink in the coiling would in running out infallibly take
somebodys arm leg or entire body off the utmost precaution is used
in stowing the line in its tub some harpooneers will consume almost an
entire morning in this business carrying the line high aloft and then
reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub so as in the act
of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists

in the english boats two tubs are used instead of one the same line
being continuously coiled in both tubs there is some advantage in this
because these twintubs being so small they fit more readily into the
boat and do not strain it so much whereas the american tub nearly
three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth makes a rather bulky
freight for a craft whose planks are but one halfinch in thickness for
the bottom of the whaleboat is like critical ice which will bear up
a considerable distributed weight but not very much of a concentrated
one when the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american linetub
the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great
weddingcake to present to the whales

both ends of the line are exposed the lower end terminating in an
eyesplice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the
tub and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything
this arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts first
in order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a
neighboring boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as
to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the
harpoon in these instances the whale of course is shifted like a mug
of ale as it were from the one boat to the other though the
first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort second this
arrangement is indispensable for common safetys sake for were the
lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat and were the
whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single smoking
minute as he sometimes does he would not stop there for the doomed
boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of
the sea and in that case no towncrier would ever find her again

before lowering the boat for the chase the upper end of the line is
taken aft from the tub and passing round the loggerhead there is again
carried forward the entire length of the boat resting crosswise upon
the loom or handle of every mans oar so that it jogs against his wrist
in rowing and also passing between the men as they alternately sit at
the opposite gunwales to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme
pointed prow of the boat where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a
common quill prevents it from slipping out from the chocks it hangs
in a slight festoon over the bows and is then passed inside the boat
again and some ten or twenty fathoms called boxline being coiled
upon the box in the bows it continues its way to the gunwale still a
little further aft and is then attached to the shortwarpthe rope
which is immediately connected with the harpoon but previous to that
connexion the shortwarp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious
to detail

thus the whaleline folds the whole boat in its complicated coils
twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction all the
oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions so that to the timid
eye of the landsman they seem as indian jugglers with the deadliest
snakes sportively festooning their limbs nor can any son of mortal
woman for the first time seat himself amid those hempen intricacies
and while straining his utmost at the oar bethink him that at any
unknown instant the harpoon may be darted and all these horrible
contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings he cannot be thus
circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones
to quiver in him like a shaken jelly yet habitstrange thing what
cannot habit accomplishgayer sallies more merry mirth better jokes
and brighter repartees you never heard over your mahogany than you
will hear over the halfinch white cedar of the whaleboat when thus
hung in hangmans nooses and like the six burghers of calais before
king edward the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death
with a halter around every neck as you may say

perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for
those repeated whaling disasterssome few of which are casually
chronicledof this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the
line and lost for when the line is darting out to be seated then in
the boat is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings
of a steamengine in full play when every flying beam and shaft and
wheel is grazing you it is worse for you cannot sit motionless in the
heart of these perils because the boat is rocking like a cradle and
you are pitched one way and the other without the slightest warning
and only by a certain selfadjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of
volition and action can you escape being made a mazeppa of and run
away with where the allseeing sun himself could never pierce you out

again as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and
prophesies of the storm is perhaps more awful than the storm itself
for indeed the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm and
contains it in itself as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal
powder and the ball and the explosion so the graceful repose of the
line as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought
into actual playthis is a thing which carries more of true terror than
any other aspect of this dangerous affair but why say more all men
live enveloped in whalelines all are born with halters round their
necks but it is only when caught in the swift sudden turn of death
that mortals realize the silent subtle everpresent perils of life
and if you be a philosopher though seated in the whaleboat you would
not at heart feel one whit more of terror than though seated before
your evening fire with a poker and not a harpoon by your side



chapter 61 stubb kills a whale


if to starbuck the apparition of the squid was a thing of portents to
queequeg it was quite a different object

when you see him quid said the savage honing his harpoon in the bow
of his hoisted boat then you quick see him parm whale

the next day was exceedingly still and sultry and with nothing special
to engage them the pequods crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep
induced by such a vacant sea for this part of the indian ocean through
which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground
that is it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises dolphins flyingfish
and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters than those off the
rio de la plata or the inshore ground off peru

it was my turn to stand at the foremasthead and with my shoulders
leaning against the slackened royal shrouds to and fro i idly swayed in
what seemed an enchanted air no resolution could withstand it in that
dreamy mood losing all consciousness at last my soul went out of my
body though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will long
after the power which first moved it is withdrawn

ere forgetfulness altogether came over me i had noticed that the seamen
at the main and mizzenmastheads were already drowsy so that at last
all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars and for every swing
that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman
the waves too nodded their indolent crests and across the wide trance
of the sea east nodded to west and the sun over all

suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes like vices my
hands grasped the shrouds some invisible gracious agency preserved me
with a shock i came back to life and lo close under our lee not forty
fathoms off a gigantic sperm whale lay rolling in the water like the
capsized hull of a frigate his broad glossy back of an ethiopian hue
glistening in the suns rays like a mirror but lazily undulating in
the trough of the sea and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury
jet the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm
afternoon but that pipe poor whale was thy last as if struck by some
enchanters wand the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once
started into wakefulness and more than a score of voices from all parts
of the vessel simultaneously with the three notes from aloft shouted
forth the accustomed cry as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted
the sparkling brine into the air

clear away the boats luff cried ahab and obeying his own order he
dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes

the sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale and ere
the boats were down majestically turning he swam away to the leeward
but with such a steady tranquillity and making so few ripples as he
swam that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed ahab gave
orders that not an oar should be used and no man must speak but in
whispers so seated like ontario indians on the gunwales of the boats
we swiftly but silently paddled along the calm not admitting of the
noiseless sails being set presently as we thus glided in chase the
monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air and
then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up

there go flukes was the cry an announcement immediately followed by
stubbs producing his match and igniting his pipe for now a respite was
granted after the full interval of his sounding had elapsed the whale
rose again and being now in advance of the smokers boat and much
nearer to it than to any of the others stubb counted upon the honour
of the capture it was obvious now that the whale had at length become
aware of his pursuers all silence of cautiousness was therefore no
longer of use paddles were dropped and oars came loudly into play and
still puffing at his pipe stubb cheered on his crew to the assault

yes a mighty change had come over the fish all alive to his jeopardy
he was going head out that part obliquely projecting from the mad
yeast which he brewed


it will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance
the entire interior of the sperm whales enormous head consists though
apparently the most massive it is by far the most buoyant part about
him so that with ease he elevates it in the air and invariably does
so when going at his utmost speed besides such is the breadth of the
upper part of the front of his head and such the tapering cutwater
formation of the lower part that by obliquely elevating his head he
thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluffbowed sluggish
galliot into a sharppointed new york pilotboat


start her start her my men dont hurry yourselves take plenty of
timebut start her start her like thunderclaps thats all cried
stubb spluttering out the smoke as he spoke start her now give em
the long and strong stroke tashtego start her tash my boystart
her all but keep cool keep coolcucumbers is the wordeasy
easyonly start her like grim death and grinning devils and raise the
buried dead perpendicular out of their graves boysthats all start
her

woohoo wahee screamed the gayheader in reply raising some
old warwhoop to the skies as every oarsman in the strained boat
involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke
which the eager indian gave

but his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild keehee
keehee yelled daggoo straining forwards and backwards on his seat
like a pacing tiger in his cage

kala kooloo howled queequeg as if smacking his lips over a
mouthful of grenadiers steak and thus with oars and yells the keels
cut the sea meanwhile stubb retaining his place in the van still
encouraged his men to the onset all the while puffing the smoke from
his mouth like desperadoes they tugged and they strained till the
welcome cry was heardstand up tashtegogive it to him the
harpoon was hurled stern all the oarsmen backed water the same
moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists
it was the magical line an instant before stubb had swiftly caught two
additional turns with it round the loggerhead whence by reason of its
increased rapid circlings a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled
with the steady fumes from his pipe as the line passed round and
round the loggerhead so also just before reaching that point it
blisteringly passed through and through both of stubbs hands from
which the handcloths or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at
these times had accidentally dropped it was like holding an enemys
sharp twoedged sword by the blade and that enemy all the time striving
to wrest it out of your clutch

wet the line wet the line cried stubb to the tub oarsman him seated
by the tub who snatching off his hat dashed seawater into it more
turns were taken so that the line began holding its place the boat now
flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins stubb and tashtego
here changed placesstem for sterna staggering business truly in that
rocking commotion


partly to show the indispensableness of this act it may here be
stated that in the old dutch fishery a mop was used to dash the
running line with water in many other ships a wooden piggin or
bailer is set apart for that purpose your hat however is the most
convenient


from the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of
the boat and from its now being more tight than a harpstring you would
have thought the craft had two keelsone cleaving the water the other
the airas the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once
a continual cascade played at the bows a ceaseless whirling eddy in
her wake and at the slightest motion from within even but of a little
finger the vibrating cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale
into the sea thus they rushed each man with might and main clinging
to his seat to prevent being tossed to the foam and the tall form of
tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double in order to bring
down his centre of gravity whole atlantics and pacifics seemed passed
as they shot on their way till at length the whale somewhat slackened
his flight

haul inhaul in cried stubb to the bowsman and facing round
towards the whale all hands began pulling the boat up to him while yet
the boat was being towed on soon ranging up by his flank stubb firmly
planting his knee in the clumsy cleat darted dart after dart into the
flying fish at the word of command the boat alternately sterning
out of the way of the whales horrible wallow and then ranging up for
another fling

the red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a
hill his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood which bubbled
and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake the slanting sun playing
upon this crimson pond in the sea sent back its reflection into every
face so that they all glowed to each other like red men and all
the while jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the
spiracle of the whale and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of
the excited headsman as at every dart hauling in upon his crooked
lance by the line attached to it stubb straightened it again and
again by a few rapid blows against the gunwale then again and again
sent it into the whale

pull uppull up he now cried to the bowsman as the waning whale
relaxed in his wrath pull upclose to and the boat ranged along
the fishs flank when reaching far over the bow stubb slowly churned
his long sharp lance into the fish and kept it there carefully
churning and churning as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold
watch that the whale might have swallowed and which he was fearful of
breaking ere he could hook it out but that gold watch he sought was the
innermost life of the fish and now it is struck for starting from
his trance into that unspeakable thing called his flurry the monster
horribly wallowed in his blood overwrapped himself in impenetrable
mad boiling spray so that the imperilled craft instantly dropping
astern had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied
twilight into the clear air of the day

and now abating in his flurry the whale once more rolled out into view
surging from side to side spasmodically dilating and contracting his
spouthole with sharp cracking agonized respirations at last gush
after gush of clotted red gore as if it had been the purple lees of red
wine shot into the frighted air and falling back again ran dripping
down his motionless flanks into the sea his heart had burst

hes dead mr stubb said daggoo

yes both pipes smoked out and withdrawing his own from his mouth
stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water and for a moment stood
thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made



chapter 62 the dart


a word concerning an incident in the last chapter

according to the invariable usage of the fishery the whaleboat pushes
off from the ship with the headsman or whalekiller as temporary
steersman and the harpooneer or whalefastener pulling the foremost
oar the one known as the harpooneeroar now it needs a strong nervous
arm to strike the first iron into the fish for often in what is called
a long dart the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of
twenty or thirty feet but however prolonged and exhausting the chase
the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost
indeed he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the
rest not only by incredible rowing but by repeated loud and intrepid
exclamations and what it is to keep shouting at the top of ones
compass while all the other muscles are strained and half startedwhat
that is none know but those who have tried it for one i cannot bawl
very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time in this
straining bawling state then with his back to the fish all at once
the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting crystand up and give it
to him he now has to drop and secure his oar turn round on his
centre half way seize his harpoon from the crotch and with what little
strength may remain he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale no
wonder taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body that out of fifty
fair chances for a dart not five are successful no wonder that so many
hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated no wonder that some
of them actually burst their bloodvessels in the boat no wonder that
some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels no wonder
that to many ship owners whaling is but a losing concern for it is the
harpooneer that makes the voyage and if you take the breath out of his
body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted

again if the dart be successful then at the second critical instant
that is when the whale starts to run the boatheader and harpooneer
likewise start to running fore and aft to the imminent jeopardy of
themselves and every one else it is then they change places and
the headsman the chief officer of the little craft takes his proper
station in the bows of the boat

now i care not who maintains the contrary but all this is both foolish
and unnecessary the headsman should stay in the bows from first to
last he should both dart the harpoon and the lance and no rowing
whatever should be expected of him except under circumstances obvious
to any fisherman i know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss
of speed in the chase but long experience in various whalemen of more
than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures
in the fishery it has not by any means been so much the speed of the
whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has
caused them

to insure the greatest efficiency in the dart the harpooneers of this
world must start to their feet from out of idleness and not from out of
toil
