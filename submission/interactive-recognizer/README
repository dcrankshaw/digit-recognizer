To run, sample program, use the command:

java -jar InteractiveRecognizer.jar

The data files need to be in the same directory as the jar file.
The program will prompt for an input, and a handwritten version
of the phrase you enter (can be multiple words) will be displayed.
Then a seralized model will run its prediction on the input
and display the result to the console.

You can enter the input any number of times per program execution.
