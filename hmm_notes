So there are two cases, one where we have just an HMM (setting I) and
one where we have an HMM acting on the results of the ANN (setting II).

For an HMM, there are 3 types of parameters that need to be
learned.

The first is the transition probabilities:
Ajk = P(zi+1 = k | zi = j)
These are stored in a matrix, and I can learn
these from my corpus dataset in both settings.

The second is the emission probabilities:
