\section*{Overview}
The idea for our project is to perform handwritten digit classification and compare the accuracies of several machine learning algorithms. We will be getting the data from the machine learning competition website, www.kaggle.com. We intend to compare the performance of two machine learning algorithms - Neural Networks and K-Nearest-Neighbors - on handwritten digit classification. We also intend to examine the effect of varying certain parameters of each algorithm. For Neural Networks, we will use both a two layer and a three layer network. For both nets, we will also look at the effects of varying the number of hidden nodes. If we have time, we would also like to implement a simple convolutional network. For nearest neighbors, we will look at using an epsilon ball approach and a k nearest neighbors approach. In both cases, we will examine weighted and unweighted variants.

\section*{Resources}
The data for our project will be coming from the \href{http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html}{MNIST database of handwritten digits}. We donâ€™t anticipate needing any other extra libraries to implement our algorithms.

\section*{Milestones}
Must achieve
Implementation of a two layer neural network
Implementation of k nearest neighbors
Comparisons of prediction efficiency and accuracy between the two algorithms
Expect to achieve
Efficiency and accuracy results as a function of the input parameters for each algorithm
Implementation of an epsilon ball nearest neighbors algorithm
Implementation of a three layer neural network
Would like to achieve
Convolutional neural network implementation
